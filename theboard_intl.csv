"Yoshinobu Yamamoto","SP","NPB",2024,"25.4083333","Japan","Orix Buffaloes","LAD",,"5' 10""","190","R","R","65","Med","A mainstay at or near the very top of this player category since 2021, Yamamoto has been the best pitcher in Japan for the last several seasons and he's a virtual lock to be an impact MLB starter from the second he ties his spikes on our shores. In his walk year with Orix, he produced two more WAR than the next best NPB pitcher (Roki Sasaki) even though Yamamoto threw 30 fewer innings (164) than he had in each of the last two seasons. He produced his third consecutive season with a sub-2.00 ERA, as well as a sterling 26.6% K%, 4.4% BB%, 53% GB%, a microscopic 1% HR/FB% and a career-best 1.74 FIP. A plus-plus on-mound athlete with mid-90s arm strength, Yamamoto locates virtually all of his pitches at will and walked just 28 batters across 164 innings in 2023. His mid-90s fastball (he averaged 95 mph but peaks in the 97-99 mph range) enjoys substantial in-zone whiff utility thanks to his velo, the rise/run shape and shallow angle of his heater, and Yamamoto's feel for locating it in the top third of the zone and above. After several consecutive seasons of decline, Yamamoto showed an uptick in two-seamer usage in 2023, though his groundball rate dropped four percentage points compared to prior years. His four-seamer pairs nicely with a nasty, old school, upper-70s curveball, which Yamamoto uses to both get ahead of and finish hitters. A low-90s splitter is his best pitch and most-deployed secondary weapon. It has exceptional bat-missing drop and doesn't need to be located precisely in order to play. A more pedestrian slider/cutter, which lives off of Yamamoto's consistent glove-side command, rounds out his repertoire. 
Inextricably linked to Japanese pitching prospects are questions about how they'll respond to a potential change in routine (a start once every five days instead of once a week) and how their breaking stuff will play upon transition to the lower-seamed MLB baseball. While these apply to Yamamoto, it's plausible an MLB team will parlay his combination of arm strength and feel for spin into a better hard slider, or variant thereof, so there is also some ""good variance"" around the way I'm projecting Yamamoto's breaking ball(s) here. The entire package is very reminiscent of peak Zack Greinke, as Yamamoto's frame, delivery, stuff quality and command are all of that ilk.","6ooumDUbaT0","sa3023345"
"Rōki Sasaki","SP","NPB",2026,"22.1972222","Japan","Chiba Lotte Marines",,,"6' 3""","203","R","R","65","High","Sasaki cemented a legacy while he was in high school. There was a stretch when he was asked to throw nearly 500 pitches in an eight-day span, including a 12-inning complete game during which he also hit the game-winning two-run homer. He became the LeBron James of Japanese baseball in the process and was the first pick in the 2019 NPB draft, wielding much more arm strength than the typical top-of-the-class arm there, touching 101 mph and sitting around 97. In 2021, Sasaki amassed a 1.98 ERA in 77 total innings across 15 starts split between the Eastern League and the Pacific League (their top league). The 2022 season was his first full slate in Japan's big league and Sasaki was great, making 20 starts, pitching 129 innings, posting a 2.02 ERA and making international headlines by throwing 17 consecutive perfect innings in April. At one point Sasaki had retired 52 consecutive batters (the MLB record is Yusmeiro Petit's 47) during that stretch. Sasaki was having an even better 2023 — 85 IP, 39% K%, 5% BB%, 62% GB%, 1.88 ERA, 0.92 FIP — before he was shut down with an oblique tear in July, which cost him most of the rest of the season. He made three appearances in September and October, where his stuff looked as crisp as usual, so while there are MLB personnel who have told me they're worried about Sasaki's medical considering his amateur usage and health track record, he looked fantastic at the end of the season. Sasaki's fastball averaged 99 mph in 2023 and he touched 103, making him the hardest-throwing pitcher in NPB history. He improved the movement on his slider and used it more often than ever before, but Sasaki's plus-plus, upper-80s splitter (which often has slider shape to his glove side and can easily be mistaken for it) is still easily his best pitch and may be the nastiest splitter on the planet. His stuff is head and shoulders better than that of Paul Skenes, from both a fastball velocity and shape standpoint, and there's really no comparison. It will be two more seasons before Sasaki has fulfilled the pro playing time and age requirements to sign with an MLB team free of financial restriction. The free agent class of pitchers after the 2025 season is star-studded and it may behoove Sasaki to wait one more year before matriculating. Still, he has top-of-the-rotation stuff and might be the most sought-after arm even among Zac Gallen, Framber Valdez, Dylan Cease, Mitch Keller, and the rest of that class.","2Wp3WweVtis",
"Munetaka Murakami","DH","NPB",2026,"23.95","Japan","Yakult Swallows",,,"6' 2""","250","L","R","55","Med","Murakami's 2023 was a bit of a letdown coming off his 10-WAR, 56-homer MVP campaign in 2022, but it was still very strong for a 23-year-old in the world's second-hardest league. After 2022, he looked like a top three to five global prospect and arguably presented a more stable statistical argument than the similarly-talented players from lower-level MLB affiliates, since Murakami had multiple years of success against polished pitching in Japan. Murakami <em>merely</em> posted a 148 wRC+ in 2023, his lowest since his age-19 season (he debuted at 18) and a far cry from his his godlike 223 wRC+ of 2022. 
Still, some actual deficiencies have begun to emerge here. This is still a very bullish forecast for Murakami, but his issues are severe enough to slide him below a few of his NPB peers and comparable upper-level stateside prospects. Ultimately, there is gargantuan lefty power here, though I've rounded down Murakami's hit tool grade pretty substantially on this update because of how things went for him in 2023. After he cut his strikeout rate for four consecutive years, Murakami's K% leapt by a third in 2023, from 21% to 28%. He is still swinging underneath a ton of fastballs up and away from him (an issue I've noted in past write-ups), and struggled significantly with velo. He managed to hit just .077 against fastballs 95 mph and above (which Murakami only saw 92 of in the entire 2023 season). Expand the sample to fastballs 94 mph and above (he faced just over 200 of them) and Murakami hit just .097, while only managing to hit three such fastballs to his pull side all season. This is a far cry from 2022, when Murakami slugged .900 against 95-plus mph heaters. He's had a career-long tendency to swing underneath fastballs up and away from him, but his complete ineptitude in 2023 is aberrant compared to career norms, and while it's definitely <em>the</em> variable to monitor over the next couple of years before he theoretically comes to MLB, I think it's apt to take a Bayesian approach that takes Murakami's past success against big fastballs into account and continue to tout him as a future MLB star who is merely coming off a rough season. 
Titanic pole-to-pole power remains Murakami's carrying tool, turning on mistakes that he sends into pull-side orbit while also spraying pitches on the outer half into the left field bleachers. There is a combination of strength, athletic explosion, and flashes of lower half flexibility here that few MLB hitters wield, and Murakami's pop stands out even when you're comparing him to MLB's most fearsome power hitters. He has a terrific ability to recognize breaking balls and offspeed stuff, and will often keep his weight back to hit secondary pitches the opposite way and use his natural strength to turn defensive swings into doubles. He has 40-homer MLB power, and it looked like he was going to solidify his hit tool enough to get to that power on our shores until this 2023 speed bump. 
Defensively, Murakami is playing third base for Yakult, but for the second straight year I'm projecting him as a DH, though readers should consider his defensive projection to be a bit more abstract than that, as it's plausible he could end up either in left field or 1B/DH. He's plodding and stiff, especially for someone approaching just 24 years old, and doesn't pass muster for me at the hot corner. The teams that like Murakami most will probably be the ones that think he can play third base (hell, Jake Burger and Max Muncy play third base), so for you fantasy players out there, it's likely Murakami does play third in the big leagues at some point (and subsequently qualifies at the position in fantasy), but it won't be pretty. The strikeout stuff needs to rebound in 2024 (not a single qualified MLB first baseman struck out 28% of the time in 2023) or teams are going to be spooked when the time comes for Murakami to be an MLB free agent.","5ukEUFjjiBY",

There are international scouting personnel whose club reports on De Vries say ""everything is at least plus,"" that he's a no-doubt shortstop with a 60- or 70-grade arm and a projectable frame, and one executive considers him the best international prospect in more than a half decade. 
De Vries can really bang from both sides of the plate. He already has oppo home run power from the left side and can drop the bat head to golf out some emphatic pull-side shots. He isn't so lanky and big-framed that you worry he'll move off of shortstop, and his twitch and arm strength give him a great chance of not only staying there but being an above-average defender or better. It's uncommon for an international amateur prospect to enter pro ball as a 50 FV player, and the track record of such players is mixed due to the volatile nature of this talent pool, but the word of mouth buzz around De Vries is deafening. He reportedly has a verbal agreement with the Padres for close to $4.5 million.",,
"Shunpeita Yamashita","SP","NPB",2028,"21.4944444","Japan","Orix Buffaloes",,,"6' 2""","215","R","R","50","High","Perhaps no Japanese pitcher took a bigger leap in 2023 than Yamashita, who sustained a five-tick (!) fastball velo bump despite a huge uptick in his workload. Yamashita posted a 1.99 ERA across 95 innings in 2023, his first in Japan's big league after two years with Orix's farm club. His fastball averaged 96 mph across the season, and he routinely peaks in the 98-99 mph range. A first round pick out of high school in 2020, Yamashita is now built like an NFL quarterback at a strapping 6-foot-2. In addition to his plus velocity, he features a monster upper-70s curveball with hitter-finishing depth, and it looks like his seldom-used splitter began to improve late in the 2023 season. Were he a 21-year-old college prospect, Yamashita would be talked about in the top three to five picks of a typical draft. He won't turn 26 until midway through 2028, so it is only after that season that Shun could come to MLB without bonus restrictions. Until then, he'll likely be one of the very best young pitchers in Japan.",,
"Jung Hoo Lee","CF","KBO",2024,"25.4","South Korea","Kiwoom Heroes","SFG",,"6' 1""","172","L","L","50","Med","Lee has been evaluated as a Top 100-quality prospect at FanGraphs since the 2020 KBO season and is an incredibly skilled contact and defense-oriented outfielder with important baseball lineage. His father, Jong-beom Lee, was a five-tool superstar ballplayer who stole as many as 84 bases in a single 124-game KBO season and had several 20-plus homer campaigns across a nearly 20-year career (!) in pro ball. 
Jung-hoo's career began in a precocious fashion, as he was the first player in KBO history to go straight from high school to their top level of play; he won Rookie of the Year as an 18-year-old in 2017. Since arriving in the league, Lee has a career .340/.407/.491 line, has made elite rates of contact (roughly 5.5% K% and 11% BB% combined the last two seasons), and has had a couple of years in which he also hit for meaningful power. He clubbed 23 homers and nearly 60 extra-base hits during his 2022 MVP campaign, but experienced a substantial downtick in power during an injury-shortened 2023, and he has hit double-digit home runs in just two of his seven KBO seasons. Lee's career groundball rate, which has typically hovered around a whopping 60%, has been a lurking indication of regression even during his best power-hitting seasons. 
Lee's carrying tool is his Jedi-like bat control, which he uses to deflect pitches all over the strike zone to all fields. His swing is incredibly cool and fun to watch, as Lee's open stance comes closed very early before he take a huge stride back toward the pitcher and unwinds from the ground up. As fun as his swing is, it bears a resemblance to Zac Veen's early-career swing both in terms of some of the stop-and-start nature in his footwork and the way his hands fire from a dead stop. His hand-eye coordination and ability to manipulate the barrel is amazing, however. Hitters in Asian pro leagues tend to face premium velocity less often than upper-level domestic prospects, which creates a wide error bar in projecting whether or not their hit tools will play here. Using Synergy to isolate Lee’s performance against fastballs at or above the MLB average (93 mph and up) yields just 154 pitches combined throughout the last two seasons; he slashed .268/.348/.415 against them. Bump the bottom boundary up to 94 mph and he slashed .276/.300/.379 across 96 pitches. Any higher a velocity bar and the sample is too small to glean anything. It might take a tweak to his swing, and ideally Lee will continue to get stronger as he matures into his late 20s, but his feel for contact is an exciting foundational skill on its own. 
If Lee doesn't end up hitting for power, his center field defense will help buoy his overall contribution to a team. He's a plus runner with above-average range and ball skills, and a plus arm. Whether he's retained that coming off a 2023 ankle injury that required surgery, teams can't know for sure. English-language reports describe his injury as an ""ankle fracture,"" and my sources indicate there was an injury to his tendon, which could mean we're talking about an avulsion fracture. Lee also had left labrum surgery in 2018. He is perhaps the highest-variance free agent on the market this offseason because there are outcomes where Lee gets stronger and does at least a little bit of everything on top of an elite hit tool, but  there are also outcomes where his center field-worthy speed is diminished and his hit tool doesn't play the same in MLB. The most likely forecast is somewhere in the middle, and here Lee projects as a table-setting center fielder without much pop, though whatever the case, teams should be prepared to make a multi-year project out of Lee so he has time to adjust in the same ways Ha-Seong Kim has.","hQYbPw53SuA","sa3012640"
"Emil Morales","SS","Int'l Amateur",2024,"17.3111111","Dominican Republic",,"LAD",2400000,"6' 3""","185","R","R","45+","High","Morales has perhaps the best long-term power projection among the 2024 international class infielders, as most of the other prospects with wide receiver-ish builds are outfielders. Morales has wide shoulders, long levers, and a high waist that gives him the look of an early-career Fernando Tatis Jr. in the uniform. Morales also has explosive power to his pull side and can already put balls out to dead center field at age 17. Unlike a lot of lanky teenage hitters, Morales' bat-to-ball performance in amateur events was statistically strong. On film, his hands have a late, deep move that I worry will make him late against pro velocity, but it's too early to care much about that. Morales bends well for an athlete of his size and build, and he has a decent shot to stay at shortstop. While he's a skill fit there, it's plausible that sheer size will force him to move in his early-to-mid-20s. Morales is expected to sign for about $2.5 million.",,

As signing day has approached, Radney has become a sleeker, speedier athlete, and now has a better chance to become a true center fielder than was anticipated. He still carries with him substantial power projection, and Radney has a non-zero chance of maturing in the Goldilocks Zone as an athlete who retains the speed to play center field while also developing big power. International scouts are also fairly bullish about Radney's bat-to-ball ability, or at least there aren't proactive doubts surrounding his hit tool. Radney is one of the few prospects in the 2024 class who has a chance to do at least a little bit of everything (and a lot of some things), and he's also one of the youngest.",,

"Shota Imanaga","SP","NPB",2024,"30.3694444","Japan","Yokohama BayStars",,,"5' 10""","176","L","L","45","Low","Imanaga presents MLB clubs with the skill set of an ultra-stable no. 4 or 5 starter thanks largely to his exceptional command. He walked just 4% of opposing hitters in 2023, his third straight season with a BB% less than 6%. Imanaga has enjoyed a gradual velocity increase since entering pro ball in 2016, culminating in a strong 2023 walk year when he set a personal record for average fastball velo across an entire season (92 mph), as well as bests in strikeout rate (29%) and xFIP (2.38) in his 143 IP. His fastballs play up a bit due to his command and his low release, which is mostly created by his powerful, flexible lower body and drop-and-drive style of delivery. His low-80s slider is his finishing secondary pitch; it has plus two-plane wipe and, like the rest of his repertoire, is aided by Imanaga’s ability to locate. His stuff is otherwise pretty pedestrian. His low-70s curveball may be too slow to play in MLB and his changeup is reliant upon location much more than stuff, but of course Imanaga's command of it is exceptional — that pitch barely ever finishes in a vulnerable spot. 
Imanaga has been slightly homer-prone in Japan, with a 8.3% HR/FB rate across the last three seasons combined; the NPB average is only 6%, half the MLB rate. Any pitcher who works at the top of the zone as often as Imanaga does is likely to have a high fly ball rate, but Imanaga’s 58% FB% (NPB average is 45%) is astronomical and points to some risk that he gets shelled by stronger MLB hitters. Perhaps I’m underrating the impact Imanaga’s command will have on his overall performance, but I think most of his value will be in the volume of innings he works rather than his pound-for-pound impact, and he strikes me as the sort of talent who gets shifted into a long relief role during October crunch time.","jVVuafVGLZ4","sa3023346"

According to a <em>Washington Post</em> article by Jesse Dougherty, Fedde went to Push Athletic in Scottsdale and remade his body, mechanics, and the shape of his three most-used pitches. He hasn't had a significant arm strength boost, but Fedde's arm slot has raised a bit, his fastball looks heavier (70% GB% in 2023!), and he has upped his changeup usage. His newly-shaped slider was easily his most dominant pitch in 2023 and generated 41% of Fedde's swings and misses. The chase rate on his changeup and slider was up around 40% for both pitches, and Fedde looked rejuvenated despite working as many innings as he did. He has a chance to make an impact similar to the one Merrill Kelly has made in Arizona and slot into a contending team's rotation.","-oxQ85lI5ok","17425"

He has six straight seasons of clubbing 30 or more home runs, including a 2023 campaign in which he hit 41 of them while slashing .278/.374/.584, good for a 178 wRC+. Okamoto has a potent contact and power combo. His swing has a little more movement and noise, but it's similar to Tommy Pham's. Okamoto's front foot tends to land open, enabling him to pull the baseball in the air a ton, but he still has great plate coverage on the outer third of the zone, similar to Pham. His hands are deft and strong, capable of putting a charge into the ball even when he doesn't square it up. On defense, Okamoto has seen time at third and first base, and isn't especially good at either. He hits well enough that he'll be a meaningfully good role player in MLB if he comes over during this mid-20s physical peak, probably a tad shy of the average corner infield regular.","Kgf4VsMzAvw",

Sanchez has a dynamic and beautiful left-handed swing that combines natural loft and barrel precision to give him one of the better looking present offensive toolsets in the class. His top hand drives the quality of his contact, and Sanchez is shorter to the baseball than most players his size and age. He's also become meaningfully stronger during the last year or so, and could be poised to move quickly through complex-level ball. The Reds have gravitated toward international prospects who the industry perceives as having more polished hit and power combinations, and that's again the case with Sanchez, whose rumored bonus with Cincinnati is a little less than $3 million.",,

Perdomo does some slick things at shortstop, he's just rather stocky and slightly stiff compared to most typical top-of-the-class prospects. His vertical barrel variability is incredible for a player his age, though his front side is a little stiff through contact and he might be tested by pro breaking stuff in the bottom third of the zone. Perdomo has a great offensive foundation for an amateur prospect, and it might allow him to move quickly through the lower minors. This is pretty consistent with Atlanta's M.O. when they're operating at the top of the international market, though Perdomo has less physical projection and athleticism than most of the industry tends to associate with a $5 million prospect.

The lefty-hitting outfield prospect just seems to sear line drives all over the place despite a somewhat odd-looking swing. If you look past his choppy, downward cut, Arias checks all the boxes. He runs well, his broad-shouldered frame is very projectable, and he tracks pitches as if his eyes are fitted with some kind of baseball-seeking laser. He also makes flush, loud contact with remarkable consistency. There are scouts who think Arias needs to get much stronger, and others who view the way he's performed despite a lack of strength as encouraging. I am mostly in the latter camp.

The added velocity came with (and was likely because of) a full-time move to the bullpen, and Rodriguez posted a 1.15 ERA in his 54 innings. Then Rodriguez pitched for Cuba's 2023 WBC team as a starter. After a rough-looking February tuneup before the actual competition began, he was nasty across 65-to-70 pitches in each of his two WBC starts, when Yariel sat 95, touched 98, and bent in a good vertical breaking ball in the 83-87 mph range. After his WBC performance, Rodriguez chose to opt out of the 2023 NPB season and focus on training to come to MLB the following year. Chunichi put him on the restricted list and Rodriguez wasn’t heard from until October, when he threw live BP for teams in the Dominican Republic and looked like his usual self. 
There may be teams that view Rodriguez as a potential MLB starter because of his repertoire depth and brief success in the WBC, but hold your horses. He started for multiple seasons in Japan and wasn't very good, with a FIP near 5.00 in 2021 prompting a bullpen move the following year. He only came into impact velocity once he moved to the 'pen and there is zero evidence that he'd be able to sustain it as a starter, in fact quite the contrary. As a relief candidate, Rodriguez is exciting and has the stuff to pitch in higher-leverage innings. His vertical fastball/breaking ball combo looks similar to Peter Fairbanks' stuff (minus a few ticks of velo) and is on par with the second- or third- best reliever coming out of a contender's bullpen.","kFqDEzmdPrc","sa3023349"

There is a very small minority of my sources who believe this might change, but mostly the front office personnel I've spoken with to gauge Martinez's 2023-24 offseason plans have received no indication that he plans to depart NPB a year early. 
Martinez is a very long and lanky 6-foot-4 righty whose fastball will peak in the 99-100 mph range. His money pitch, however, is a low-90s splitter that is not only capable of missing bats but also enables him to generate a ton of groundballs. Across 46.2 innings in 2023, Martinez posted a 58% GB%, a 36% K% and a paltry 2% BB%. The incredibly low walk rate marks three straight seasons Martinez has walked fewer than 6% of opposing hitters. His height, lever length, and extremely vertical arm slot creates downhill plane on his fastball that detracts somewhat from its ability to miss bats.

There is no consensus about whether Ricardo will be able to stay at shortstop — international scouts and execs have mixed shortstop and third base projections here.

He first appeared on the International Players section of The Board last year when he posted the second-highest swinging strike rate in NPB behind Livan Moinelo (a name to stash away for next offseason). Despite sitting mostly 91-94 throughout the season, he ranked fourth in K% in 2023 among pitchers who threw at least 40 innings (32.4%) because his fastball misses a ton of bats at the letters thanks to its flat approach angle and vertical movement. The supremely athletic 5-foot-8 lefty has a due north arm slot that helps impart a nearly perfect back spinning axis on his fastball. Sometimes pitchers with this high a slot end up having a steep, downhill fastball angle, but Matsui's lack of size helps counterbalance that, and his bouncy on-mound athleticism should enable him to hold up across a typical 60-inning big league relief workload despite being so small. As pedestrian as Matsui's fastball velocity is, his splitter is quite firm (usually 86-88 mph). It's his most-used secondary pitch; his usage of it has increased in each of the last several seasons and grew to a career-high 35% in 2023. Matsui also has a true two-plane mid-80s slider that is of big league quality, but his usage of it was cut nearly in half in 2023, way down to 10%. It’s a good looking pitch and probably deserves more air time. Despite lacking typical big league reliever arm strength, Matsui looks like a very stable and versatile big league middle reliever. I've gassed his FV a little bit above my typical 40 FV for a role like this because Matsui's mix should enable him to get hitters of both handednesses out. That said, I don't think he has stuff quite on par with a contender's set-up man, which is more a 45 FV for me.","p23yG-9wJ18","sa3023348"

He'll tend to use the curveball as a finishing pitch, while the slider and cutter are more neutral, strike-garnering offerings. An projected as a reliever at this site throughout 2021, but while there are still some reliever-y elements here (fastball strike quality, a lack of changeup feel), his demonstrated durability moves him firmly into the starter bucket.

He has a power fastball that peaks at 99 mph and sits 93-96 with flat angle created by his lack of height. At 5-foot-8, Tseng is short but he isn't small, and his lower body is incredibly strong and flexible, helping quell concerns about any kind of durability issues. Conversely, Tseng enjoys the benefits of having a lower release height because he's so short, which helps the bat-missing shape of his fastball. The finish of his slurve is rather inconsistent, but it's possible a big league dev program will quickly improve that part of his game. He looks like a solid middle reliever by virtue of his fastball, and he has a chance to be a more impactful, higher-leverage contributor if an MLB team can improve his breaking ball. Somewhat surprisingly, he filed for international free agency after the 2023 season. Because he isn't old enough to be exempt from MLB's international bonus restrictions (he has neither the foreign pro experience nor the requisite age to be a true free agent), it's probable an NPB team will trump what MLB clubs could offer Jyun-Yue this offseason.

This, plus Moinelo's recent stated desire to move from the bullpen to the starting rotation, makes his potential MLB timeline and role less clear than it has been for the last handful of years when he's been a steady late-inning reliever for Fukuoka as well as the Cuban National Team. Moinelo certainly has the stuff to start, but whether or not he has the command and stamina (especially coming off of a surgery) we just won't know until he's asked to pitch through a lineup multiple times. Prior to his injury, Moinelo was sitting 95 mph and touching 98 with regularity while mixing in three MLB-quality secondary pitches pretty evenly. His upper-80s slider and mid-80s curveball (which often spin in excess of 2,900 rpm) have distinct shapes, while Moinelo's changeup quality has dipped a bit as his arm slot has been raised to a more due north position. His walk rates have come way down the last two seasons, but especially in 2023 when he threw just shy of 30 innings before blowing out; it's a pretty small sample and not enough for me to comfortably project him as a starter just yet.

Though there are times when he closes off and covers the outer third of the zone with aplomb, Roh's leg kick often causes him to bail on sliders a little too early, and his hips end up flying open to the third base side a lot, causing him to swing inside sliders that finish on the plate. He's more of a mistake hitter than he is pounding pitches all over the zone, but his uptick in production and change in physicality is notable.

The Braves picked him eighth overall, but flunked his post-draft medical (wrist) and tried to sign him for a reduced amount. During that stretch, the relationship between the player and the team disintegrated, and Stewart, who was committed to Mississippi State, chose not to sign. Rather than go to Starkville, he spent a year at a Florida junior college to re-enter the draft, but his stuff took a dive and so did his stock. He made a move to Japan with an eye on pitching there until he was granted unrestricted free agency after six years. 
Things haven't gone great. Stewart has struggled to throw strikes and spent all of 2022 in the NPB equivalent of the minors, walking nearly a batter per inning. He ended up picking up reps in the 2022-23 Puerto Rican Winter League, where his on-paper results were better from a strike-throwing standpoint. He finally got an extended run in the 2023 NPB big league, where he threw 77.1 innings as a starter, plus 23 more in the minors. Stewart dominated the NPB farm league but was more pedestrian in the Pacific League (19% K%, 12% BB%). He continues to sit 93-95 mph with fairly hittable downhill plane that makes it imperative that he begin commanding his fastball more consistently to the top of the zone. He could also stand to become stronger and more flexible in his lower body, anything that might help flatten the line on his fastball or help him repeat his delivery more consistently. Stewart's trademark curveball still has fantastic, bat-missing depth, and he has added a firmer, mid-80s slider and, most prominently, a splitter. All of these play down because of Stewart's poor control. Given his pro track record of strike-throwing, Stewart is purely an up/down middle relief prospect at this point, but he is very much still a prospect and the time when he was originally forecast to return is nearly here. He's still worth monitoring even though he hasn't taken a huge leap from a skill and polish standpoint.",,
