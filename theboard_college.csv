"1",,,"J.J. Wetherholt","2B","ColH","21.8361111","5' 11""","180","L","R","West Virginia",,"50","Low","Coming off a cartoonish .449/.517/.787 slash line as a sophomore. Plus lefty bat speed with lift and plate coverage. Tightly-wound but explosive, often has huge finish through contact. Big bat wrap gives him a very aggressive angle of attack with the barrel, feel for oppo contact saves him when he's a little late. Underclass contact rates (93% in-zone) sure make it seem like this swing works. Had average big league raw power as a soph and looked stronger in the fall. 
Very exciting offensive prospect typical of a top five pick in spite of lackluster defense. Played a mix of second and third base at WVU, with corner outfield reps in summer ball. Not an especially good second base defender. Slow to approach grounders, which he'll be punished for in pro ball. Plays with effort and awareness but isn't especially skilled or rangy. Shot to be 40-grade second base defender; lower-end defensive outcome is left field. Probable everyday player in left, impact guy if he can stay at second.",,
"2",,,"Travis Bazzana","2B","ColH","21.8694444","6' 0""","199","L","R","Oregon State",,"50","Low","A compact Aussie cut from the same cloth as Rougned Odor and Brian Dozier. A career .340/.463/.549 hitter as an underclassman. Plate coverage with power and lift. Can bang to all fields. Short levers enable him to turn on inside stuff with power, raw strength and bat speed give him oppo gap doubles pop. Most notable data characteristic is consistency of lift and power together, which is also evident on look. Uphill, damage-causing bat path all over the zone, lower body can dip to help him scoop low pitches. Not a very projectable athlete, nor a very good second base defender. A 40-grade athlete in space, below-average hands and arm. Very similar to J.J. Wetherholt without quite as typical of a big league build, but à la Rougie there's lots of precedent. Shot to be an Edouard Julien sequel.",,
"3",,,"Jac Caglianone","SP/1B","TWP","21.4222222","6' 5""","245","L","L","Florida",,"50","High","The freakishly talented Caglianone presents a serious conundrum to teams picking atop the 2024 draft. He is as talented and toolsy a college player as there has ever been, wielding elite fastball velocity and raw power, but Caglianone's command and plate discipline are both so lacking that they threaten his entire profile. He slugged .735 and hit 33 homers as a sophomore, but long levers and poor ball/strike recognition cause Cags to chase (42% in 2023!) and whiff quite a bit. These issues may be too significant for him to profile as a first baseman or (speculatively) right fielder. Caglianone did not pitch as a freshman and was wild as a sophomore, but he has an ideal pitcher's frame at a hulking 6-foot-5. He's limber and loose and powers down the mound with ease, and his fastball routinely sits 97-100. Caglianone also has a great changeup, but his two breaking balls (an upper-80s slider/cutter and low-80s slurve) are wildly inconsistent, as are his command and overall feel for pitching. 
I'm inclined to project on Caglianone's command and secondary stuff because he has basically all the athletic traits one looks for in an impact starting pitcher, and there are good reasons to believe he can tune up these lackluster skills if/when he ever focuses solely on pitching. I'm not as comfortable projecting on his plate discipline and contact ability, characteristics that I consider more inherent and tougher to tweak, in part because Cags is so lanky and long. His offensive profile is exciting, but very shaky. I also think whichever team drafts him would be foolish if they didn't let him try to develop as a two-way player. This is a much more talented version of Brendan McKay, and as minor league roster spots become more and more valuable due to the domestic reserve limit, it feels good mushing two prospects into one roster spot. Caglianone will very likely be the most famous of the 2024 draftees because of his absurd ability, and he'd probably be a top 10 pick were he only considered a pitcher. He has the talent to go first overall, but I'm not sure teams picking atop the draft have the stomach for this level of risk.",,
"4",,,"Seaver King","CF","ColH","21.2111111","6' 0""","190","R","R","Wake Forest",,"45+","High","Transfer from Division-II Wingate but has experience against top competition and with wood bats. Raked on Cape Cod (17 games, .424/.479/.542) and was among the most impressive athletes on Collegiate Team USA. Has a shot to go first in this draft. Presents a much more typical athletic look than the other top college hitters in the draft class. Incredible lower body athleticism and bat control. Built like a souped up Eric Brown; Zach Neto is also a fair recent comp in terms of build and bat speed. Top to bottom plate coverage. Expands the zone a ton and has the bat control to make it work right now. Believe in the power due to the athleticism and think the contact piece could be special. Synergy has him charted at an 87% z-contact rate, but also chasing at an excessive 33% clip across all of King's 2023 tape. Whether he progresses in these areas and if he can settle into an up-the-middle defensive position (hopefully center field or second base) will have a huge impact on where he's drafted, which could be very high. Mostly played left side of the infield at Wingate, looked fine on tape last summer at the keystone, ceiling on his overall profile is bigger is he can play center.",,
"5",,,"Nick Kurtz","1B","ColH","21.3305555","6' 5""","235","L","L","Wake Forest",,"45+","Med","Gigantic individual with enormous strength. Mammoth, 70-grade pull power generated by high-effort swings. Plus-plus measurable raw power and plate discipline with max exits around 117 mph. Can he hit for power with a toned down swing? Current style of hitting — huge leg kick, aggressive stride, bat warp — leaves him very vulnerable on the outer third. To the eye, this will be a bigger issue in pro ball. The data is a little more reassuring — 85% z-contact%, 80% overall — and the plate discipline portion of the profile is soundly present. Surprisingly agile first base defender with a good arm. Splits against pro-caliber velocity at the end of his college run will be an important variable to consider given his particular swinging strike issues. Power this huge with OBP tends to play in spite of elevated strikeouts, but it might take an eventual adjustment for Kurtz to also be a good enough contact hitter in pro ball to separate himself from the 45/50-grade area of the big league first base group.",,
"6",,,"PJ Morlando","LF","HSh","19.1527777","6' 3""","198","L","R","Summerville HS (SC)","South Carolina","45+","High","Best present power among high schoolers in the 2024 draft. Titanic left-handed pop, absurd BP power for a hitter his age, has made big league parks look small with a wood bat. Strapping, big-framed lefty power bat capable of crushing belt-high fastballs at high school velocities. Swing looks long and might be vulnerable to Ks against pro velo, but for now Morlando's 2-to-1 BIP-to-whiff ratio is rather encouraging. Talent to clear corner outfield bar on offense is clearly here. Has the best chance of any high school player to be taken inside the top 10.",,
"7",,,"Chase Burns","SIRP","ColP","21.5138888","6' 4""","215","R","R","Wake Forest",,"45+","High","Triple-digit arm strength and an elite slider should enable Burns to be a great reliever if it turns out he can't start. Fastball sits 96, has been up to 102. Heater plays down a little bit due to downhill plane and lack of command. Arm swing is very long and hard to repeat. Slider had a 60% miss rate in 2023 — it often crests 90 mph and his feel for locating it is much better than that of his heater. Can subtract velo from the breaking ball to land a curveball in the zone and throws an occasional changeup. Transferred from Tennessee to Wake Forest for his draft year. It's possible Wake will cure some of his ills. Arm action was still long in the fall. There's huge starter upside here if Burns can find a third pitch and viable command.",,
"8",,,"Kyle Debarge","SS","ColH","20.9888888","5' 9""","170","R","R","Louisiana - Lafayette",,"45","Med","Little sportscar of an athlete with premium contact ability. Plus runner, agile low-to-the-ground athlete with plenty of arm for shortstop. Plus-plus plate coverage despite high-effort swing. Athleticism lets him swing with surprising force for a hitter his size, but a lot of the contact is on the ground. Expect the teams that value contact ability and up-the-middle defenders to be on him in the comp round.",,
"9",,,"Jonathan Santucci","SP","ColP","21.5361111","6' 2""","205","L","L","Duke",,"45","Med","Santucci had surgery to clean up bone chips in his elbow last year, but looked nasty in the fall and during 2024 preseason activity. If he can throw strikes, he might be the most complete pitcher in the draft. Will sit 96-97 early in outings, fastball plays at the belt due to deception and shallow angle. Command of mid-80s slider has helped it play like a plus-plus pitch. Changeup flashes bat-missing action but not consistently. Lots of starter traits here but hasn't proven it from a health and command standpoint yet. Has a chance to be first pitcher off the board.",,
"10",,,"Josh Hartle","SP","ColP","21.2972222","6' 5""","200","L","L","Wake Forest",,"45","Med","Arrived on campus as a lanky lefty with 40 stuff and has develop a robust repertoire that's enabled him to dominate the ACC even though he hasn't started throwing any harder. Had a 2.81 ERA and 140 K in 102.1 innings. Only sitting 88-90 but mixes in three plus breaking balls in the 8-90 mph range: a curveball, slider, and cutter. Plus command, hides the ball well, repeats his delivery. Will leap into the top 10 with more 2024 velo.",,
"11",,,"Cam Smith","3B","ColH","21.3861111","6' 3""","220","R","R","Florida State",,"40+","High","Elite size and power projection. Big, broad-shouldered third baseman with rare defensive ability for a player his size. Big all-fields power, often inside-outs the baseball because he's late, but has the strength to do damage that way. Extremely crude feel to hit and feel for the zone. Lack of plate discipline might be a serious problem on its own. Tools and ceiling should keep him in afloat in the second round despite a risky profile.",,
"12",,,"Konnor Griffin","RF","HSh","18.2138888","6' 4""","205","R","R","Jackson Prep (MS)","LSU","40+","High","One of the precious few 2024 high schoolers who enters their senior spring with juicy tools. Risky, long-levered corner outfield prospect with huge power projection and plus speed. Reads and routes in the outfield aren't great even though Griffin has the speed for center field. Bat-to-ball track record is very good across multiple years on showcase circuit, but lever length often makes Griffin late on fastballs and this will probably get worse in pro ball. Incredible twitch for a prospect his size, changes direction on a dime, explodes out of the batter's box. Toolsy high school outfielders like this typically come off the board in the middle-third of the first round.",,
"13",,,"Noah Franco","RF","HSh","18.1611111","6' 3""","188","L","L","IMG Academy (FL)","TCU","40+","Med","Two-way player who I prefer as a hitter. Well-rounded prospect with contact-oriented foundation and the physical projection to layer power on top. Tracks pitches well, guides barrel all over the zone, all fields line drive/groundball contact right now. Frame has room for mass and strength. Hit tool might take yet another leap as he focuses on hitting in pro ball. Late-first round prospect.",,
"14",,,"Carter Johnson","SS","HSh","18.3861111","6' 2""","180","L","R","Oxford HS (AL)","Alabama","40+","Med","Hitterish high school shortstop. Smooth lefty stroke, obvious barrel feel, great vertical plate coverage and all-fields spray. Medium frame and physicality, much more a smooth and effortless style of play than an explosive one. Teams commonly use late first round picks on prospects like this and hope to develop their strength. If Johnson shows that he's already taken a bit of a leap in this way as a senior, then he'll climb the draft board.",,
"15",,,"Brody Brecht","SP","ColP","21.7888888","6' 4""","185","R","R","Iowa",,"40+","High","Epitomizes crude arm strength. Super stiff, odd arm action that somehow generates upper-90s velo. Big, sturdy frame similar to Jacoby Brissett. Slider-first approach to pitching because his fastball command is so raw. It has generated nearly elite miss and has big vertical drop for a pitch averaging 87 mph. Control is so unkempt that Brecht is overwhelmingly likely to be a reliever. Teams still take a shot on guys like this in the middle of the first round.",,
"16",,,"Caleb Lomavita","C","ColH","21.6472222","5' 11""","200","R","R","Cal",,"40+","High","Compact catcher with plus arm and pull pop. Slugged .612 as a soph. Toned down his leg kick during summer ball and it robbed him of some power. Ditching the leg kick may have been with an eye on simplifying things to limit Lomavita's chase, which is an issue. Covers the top of the zone well, average overall bat-to-ball skill. Arm is plus more because of accuracy than strength; Lomavita's release is effortless and consistent. Needs to improve as a receiver. Pretty toolsy catching prospect with an early second round look.",,
"17",,,"Tommy White","1B","ColH","21.3583333","6' 1""","228","R","R","LSU",,"40+","Med","Barrel-chested college baseball cult hero with plus-plus bat speed. White has slashed .368/.429/.740 as an underclassman with 51 homers in 121 games. Thicker build in the pre-2023 Eugenio Suárez mold. Super loose and explosive rotator. Surprisingly mobile, low-to-the-ground defender for his size; arm strength fits at third. Hands are not great but has a better chance to stay at third than you'd guess when he got off the bus. Peak measurable power rivals that of big league sluggers. Potentially fatal chase issues — 56% swing rate, 38% chase rate in college — are here, especially because we're talking about a right/right corner profile. Much more of a big league athleticism/bat speed look than some other flawed hitters in the 2024 class. Projects as a Ty France type because of the swing decision issues and third base trending toward first base defensive fit, but White has more power.",,
"18",,,"Braden Montgomery","SIRP/RF","TWP","21.2361111","6' 2""","201","S","R","Texas A&M ",,"40+","High","Comes from a family of several Division-I athletes that also supposedly has a helipad in their yard so his former Iowa track athlete mom can be airlifted to perform emergency surgeries. A two-way player and switch-hitter with plus power. Above-average bat speed from both sides of the plate. Crude power. Swing elements are raw from both sides, especially the left. Hilariously strong arm; hosed a guy from the warning track at Scottsdale Stadium during the Pac-12 tournament. On the mound, stuff was down in 2023. Has peaked in 94-97 range, was more in the low-90s late in 2023 and on Cape Cod. Strapping 6-foot-3 or so, has prototypical pitcher's frame. Possible to draft as a two-way guy because his innings count will probably be limited upon pro entry since he's only been a reliever in college. Fun developmental prospect with hit tool risk on one hand and relief likelihood on the other.",,
"19",,,"Slade Caldwell","CF","ColH","18.0638888","5' 8""","175","L","L","Valley View HS (AR)","Ole Miss","40+","Med","Plus-plus running quarter-stick of dynamite. Stocky and explosive center fielder with quick wrists in the batter's box. Catalytic qualities, plus contact performance on the showcase circuit. Body is very muscular and closed to maxed out, but so was Jett Williams'. Late first round prospect.",,
"20",,,"Mike Sirota","CF","ColH","21.0694444","6' 3""","187","R","R","Northeastern",,"40+","Med","Speedy power-over-hit center field prospect with plus plate discipline. Tightly wound athlete with narrow build, wiry and strong. Hands are especially lively with low-ball power. Likely going to swing underneath a ton of in-zone fastballs. Speed fits in center; reads and routes need polish but the footspeed is there. On-base ability buoys profile and gives Sirota an everyday shot; projected issues with the hit tool and his flavor of build/athleticism look more like a part-time outfielder.",,
"21",,,"Austin Overn","CF","ColH","21.1694444","6' 0""","175","L","R","USC",,"40+","High","Simon Muzziotti body comp, some swing similarities too. Plus-plus runner and potentially plus center field defender who needs to get stronger. Played some wide receiver at SC. Gap-to-gap speed on defense, loose rotator in the box with average contact ability and below-average power. Has a shot to break out in 2024 if he adds strength and pop.",,
"22",,,"Vance Honeycutt","CF","ColH","21.15","6' 3""","205","R","R","North Carolina",,"40+","High","Power/speed center field prospect with hit tool risk. Has posted a .279/.413/.594 career line with much better performance as a freshman. Has the speed for center, but ball skills are only fair. Stiff, deep load of his hands when he swings leaves him vulnerable to high heat. Below-average swing-and-miss data. More average than plus center field defense puts him into more of a complementary role bucket than that of a true starter.",,
"23",,,"Cam Caminiti","SP","HSp","17.925","6' 2""","205","L","L","Saguaro HS (AZ)","LSU","40+","High","Very similar to Marlins 2023 comp rounder Thomas White. Prototypical frame, mid-90s arm strength at peak, big breaking ball depth. Timing of arm swing is often late, command can waver. Lefty prep dev project with frame/breaking ball combo driving excitement.",,
"24",,,"Charlie Condon","1B","ColH","21.2416666","6' 6""","211","R","R","Georgia",,"40+","High","6-foot-6 right/right power over hit corner profile. Set SEC freshman record for homers and slugged .800. Plus bat speed, 70 measurable raw power. Trim and loose for a player his size. Swing is quite grooved, geared for power on pitches down-and-in like Matt Vierling's, but Condon doesn't really move the barrel around with much skill right now. Apprehension around the hit tool has him more in my second round mix to start the spring.",,

Huge curveball, 12-to-6 shape and virtually impossible for hitters to see out of Holman's hand. Body built for durability. Fastball's lack of in-zone play could be an issue. Needs to develop a third pitch, but has a better shot to start than some of the other college arms with relief risk.",,

Funky delivery is tight and violent, has a bullpen look. Low-90s fastball with deceptive ride, but best pitch is easily his low-80s slider, which has nasty, late break. Needs to find a third pitch and improve command to start; projected as a reliever here.",,

Great timing, wrists are quick through the zone. Below-average power, inconsistent shortstop defender. Not especially sure-handed, arm accuracy is mixed. Lack of power could make it tough to profile at non-shortstop positions. Low-variance player with a high-variance draft stock that will be influenced by whether or not he shows more power or better defense as a junior.",,

Agile receiver with soft hands, catches pitches moving back toward the zone. Wide-based ball blocker to the extreme. Quick out of crouch and good arm, though some throws sail on him.
