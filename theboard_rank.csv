1,0,"Jackson Holliday","BAL","SS","ST",2024,"70","Med",,"20.2722222","6' 0""","185","L","R",2022,"Draft","BAL",8190000,"Stillwater HS (OK)","Holliday exited his pre-draft summer as a mid-to-late first-round prospect. Among the high school prospects from that draft class, he not only had perhaps the best chance to remain at shortstop, but he also had one of the better bat-to-ball track records overall, accumulating a 3-to-1 ball in play-to-whiff ratio on the showcase circuit. He was also one of the better rotational athletes available, with one of the loosest, most beautiful swings in the class. It seemed plausible he might eventually grow into meaningful power, and by his senior year of high school, Holliday already had. He looked like a do-everything prospect as a senior and ultimately went first overall to Baltimore. 
Jackson was then shot out of a canon in his first full pro season. He slashed .323/.442/.499 across four levels and ended the season with Triple-A Norfolk at age 19. Holliday isn't an ironclad, fully actualized entity as a hitter just yet, but he's unbelievably talented in terms of both his coordination and his in-the-box athleticism. He maintained above-average rates of contact in 2023 despite usually being 3-5 years younger than the typical player at High- and Double-A, tallied 101 walks in just 125 games, had 51 extra-base hits, and stole 24 bases (he was caught nine times). Again, this was Holliday's first full professional season as a teenage shortstop. 
There are all kinds of scouting traits to get excited about here in addition to his performance. Holliday has a big, slow leg kick, takes a huge stride forward, and has loose and explosive hips and hands that helped him post a 45% hard-hit rate last season (neck and neck with Wyatt Langford, even though Jackson is a couple years younger). Even though Holliday's stride can sometimes pull him off toward first base, he finds ways to get his arms extended to cover the outer edge of the plate anyway. 
He's a very special young hitter, though there are a couple of nits worth picking; it is the very top of the prospect list after all. Holliday struggled to pull fastballs in 2023 and slugged less than .400 against them, per Synergy. His contact rates and chase rates are good, but they're also a grade below what Langford did in pro ball across the board. Holliday's measurable power is, in most respects, pretty comfortably below the big league average at the moment even though he just got done slugging .499. He also isn't currently a big league-quality shortstop defender and definitely isn't better than Gunnar Henderson is right now. Holliday played 20 games at second base in 2023 and that might be the path to an earlier debut for him, but he’s talented enough to project as a suitable shortstop within the next couple of years. His ability to make accurate throws from odd platforms is impressive, as are Holliday’s poise and internal clock. He’s most comfortable throwing on the move and often goes out of his way to do so even when it isn't called for. Holliday lets a lot of choppers take an unnecessarily high hop, with the direction of that hop sometimes surprising him. He needs to do a better job of staying low and attacking this type of ball in play closer to the ground. 
We're splitting hairs because we're talking about the top couple of spots on a universal pref list, and you could make an argument for Langford to be no. 1 because impact offensive ability is so clearly on board. But Holliday has all of the scout-y athletic traits that indicate that most of where he currently falls short will improve as his body matures. He's a young middle infielder, and Langford might be a DH. It might take a year longer than Orioles fans want it to, but Holliday is very likely to become a 5-WAR shortstop who does everything well.","kLSYztort4s","sa3020241"

Then he slashed .373/.498/.769 as a junior and solidified himself as a top-three talent in a loaded draft. 
After he signed, Langford lit pro ball on fire for the better part of two months, slashing a combined .360/.480/.677 as he climbed all the way to Triple-A. During that 200 PA span, Langford's underlying TrackMan data was so good that you could use it to spearhead an argument that he should be first on the overall prospect list, with plus measurable power and plate discipline, as well as an 81% contact rate. If you buy that Langford is actually that good, then he's perhaps the most complete hitter in the minors. It's rare for hitters to hit the ball both as often as Langford has and as hard as he does, even among big leaguers. Buff and twitchy, the short-levered Langford's arms are nearly as thick as they are long, and Mike Trout is a fair body comp. His compact swing allows it to enter the hitting zone very quickly, enabling him to stay short to the ball and crush letter-high pitches, which is how he does most of his extra-base damage. Langford is apt to swing inside pitches on the outer third of the plate, perhaps because his levers are so short and he can't reach out there, and also because he's a bit of a bucket strider whose style of swinging is pretty common around baseball (Davis Schneider and a bunch of other Blue Jays swing like this, Henry Davis too). Langford's lower half is quite flexible and strong, and so are his hands. He has titanic power and is much better than a lot of the other top prospects at turning on velocity. 
Langford is also incredibly fast for a player his size, and some of his home-to-first times are a 70 on the scouting scale. Even though he has the speed for center and has played there a little bit, his feel for the position (and for playing outfield defense in general) is very poor. He's simply not comfortable out there, but his pure speed gives him a shot to be an impact defender if he can find his footing over time. Langford is a much more dangerous hitter than Jackson Holliday is right now. His power is fully actualized and he's much more likely to play an impact big league role from the jump than Holliday is, especially if the Rangers just DH Langford. Risk that this might happen anyway, especially with Leody Taveras and Evan Carter both around, is why Langford slots in as prospect no. 2 overall.",,"sa3022654"
3,1,"Jackson Chourio","MIL","CF","ST",2024,"65","Med",,"20.0027777","5' 11""","198","R","R",2021,"J2","MIL",1900000,"Venezuela","Chourio, who turns 20 in March, has been among the very best prospects in baseball for the better part of the past 18 months. He turned 19 just before the start of the 2023 season and slashed .280/.336/.467 in 122 games at Double-A Biloxi before the Brewers gave him a six-game shot of espresso at Triple-A Nashville in late September. His power, speed, and, more recently, his improvements on defense give him rare upside as a 30/30 threat and plus center field defender. During the offseason, Milwaukee signed Chourio to an eight-year (plus two options), $82 million contract that could earn Chourio as much as $140 million depending on whether those options are exercised. 
Chourio checks most of the boxes from a visual scouting standpoint. He’s a plus-plus runner (routinely 4.10 from home to first, at times a jailbreak 4.00 seconds flat) who has grown into being a great center field defender even though the former second baseman has only played there full-time for two seasons and change. He also has plus-plus bat speed and is capable of putting balls into the seats to all fields. The length of his swing might make it tough for Chourio to catch up to major league velocity up around his hands, and there’s a rigidity to the way his hands work that we don't love, which is where the little bit of hit tool risk comes from. But Chourio’s talent is so electrifying that even if he’s a flawed contact hitter, he’s still going to do enough other stuff at a high level to be a star player.
Plus, it’s encouraging that Chourio’s strikeout rate has improved since early in 2022, when he first began using this high-octane swing. It’s possible he’s just getting better feel for this relatively new style of swinging over time and that everything will be fine. He’s also developed a more dynamic approach during the last two seasons and is now cutting out his leg kick with two strikes. Because he’s already shown the aptitude to make adjustments like this, we can expect that he'll be able to shorten up his swing if it turns out he needs to. Again, whatever qualms we have with Chourio’s swing he makes up for with his bat speed (which enables him to smash fastballs he’s a bit late on toward the opposite field) and the power he generates on contact. The Baby Acuña comps are a little overzealous, as Chourio’s body and athletic style are both much more tightly wound than Ronald Acuña Jr.’s. Indeed, from a build and swing standpoint, Bo Bichette is a more apt comparison.","c5gspkixrs0","sa3015704"
4,0,"Junior Caminero","TBR","RF","ST",2024,"60","High",,"20.6861111","6' 1""","235","R","R",2019,"J2","CLE",225000,"Dominican Republic","Powerful and explosive, the exciting Caminero was among the DSL's home run leaders in 2021 before coming over from Cleveland in a 40-man roster deadline trade for pitcher Tobias Myers that offseason. He mashed his way across five minor league levels in two years and reached the big leagues in 2023 just a couple months after his 20th birthday. 
Caminero is a career .316/.383/.555 hitter in the minors and slugged 31 homers in 2023. He's on a 39 HR per 162 games pace as a pro hitter when you also incorporate his LIDOM and Aussie League at-bats into the equation. Caminero has plus-plus bat speed and raw power right now at age 20, and swings with bloodthirsty effort. He loads his hands super deep and high and has a huge bat wrap. Caminero is often late into the hitting zone against fastballs, but his bat speed is so ridiculous that he's still able to torch deeper-travelling heaters to the opposite field with home run power. Caminero's cacophonous cut leaves him vulnerable to good velocity up around his hands, which is where he does a lot of his swinging and missing. His breaking ball recognition and overall plate discipline are both pretty crude, but his feel for contact has carried enough water to keep him from having any significant strikeout issues so far, as Cami has tended to K in the 14-18% range as a pro. 
Caminero began to transition from shortstop to third base in 2023, and candidly he did not look good playing third in winter ball for Escogido during the offseason. WIth Wander Franco seemingly out of the picture and Taylor Walls recovering from hip surgery, we could see how readers might hope for the Rays to run Caminero out at shortstop again. More likely, they'll try to ""Wendle"" José Caballero into the shortstop position and live with below-average defense from Caminero at third base like they did for a while with Yandy Díaz. Caminero's size for his age and the inconsistency of his arm accuracy have us projecting him into an outfield corner, where we think he'll perform like Marcell Ozuna.","jgEhA6bbNE8","28163"
5,0,"Ethan Salas","SDP","C","ST",2026,"60","Med",,"17.7805555","6' 2""","185","L","R",2023,"Intl15","SDP",5600000,"Venezuela","Salas was generally viewed as the best prospect in the 2023 international amateur class, and weeks after signing in January for a whopping $5.6 million, he went to Arizona and began to reinforce that notion. Salas, still just 16, was performing well in Double-A or big league ""B games"" against players who often had five to 10 years on him (he doubled off of George Kirby, for instance). After a few weeks in extended spring training (a level above where most 17-year-olds play), the Padres assigned Salas to Low-A Lake Elsinore just before he turned 17. He aced a two-month test there (122 wRC+), and the Padres promoted him to High- and then Double-A for the last several weeks of the season (he struggled). 
Whether there was real value or merit to the way San Diego promoted Salas late last year is debatable, but it's also immaterial. Salas has so far exceeded what were already reasonably high expectations. With huge physical tools (power projection, arm strength) already in hand before he signed, Salas has now also demonstrated skillful feel for contact against pro pitching and shown he is a prodigiously talented defender. He's a do-everything prospect with a chance to be one of the best players in baseball. The game appears very easy and slow to him, and Salas is effortlessly good at every aspect of it. His hitting hands are explosive but also under control, and Salas has great vertical plate coverage and the makings of all-fields power. He posted a 75% contact rate and 83% Z-contact%, which are both close to big league average, but remember that we're talking about a 17-year-old in full season ball. Salas' hands can trigger late at times, leaving him tied up inside. It won't be long before he's strong enough to swing hard without having to wind his hands up in the way that causes this. 
Salas projects to have a contact and power combination that would make him an impact regular at virtually any position, and he's also going to be a dynamite defensive catcher. He throws to the bases effortlessly and accurately, his size and lateral agility should make him a great ball-blocker with time, and by the end of 2023, he was framing Double-A pitches with incredible skill for a catcher his age. The risk with teenage catching is extreme, and while the Padres pushed Salas aggressively in some respects, he only caught 34 games during the season (when you add up his pre-season activity and extended spring training, it's probably more like 55-60), so Salas' offense hasn't yet had to withstand the physical erosion of catching 90-plus games. He could spend all of 2024 at Double-A and all of 2025 at Triple-A and still be on pace to debut before he turns 20. This is one of the best couple of prospects in baseball and the odds-on favorite to be no. 1 overall next year.","lUu9qAz-0-w","sa3020881"
6,0,"James Wood","WSN","CF","ST",2025,"60","High",,"21.4861111","6' 7""","240","L","L",2021,"Draft","SDP",2600000,"IMG Academy","Wood is one of only a couple minor leaguers with such immense physical potential that they have a realistic shot to be an elite, perhaps generational player, or at least a player of singular ability. Like Elly De La Cruz and Oneil Cruz before him, Wood has issues that threaten to undermine his profile, but he's so overtly gifted that he's one of only a few prospects with a realistic shot at being a 70-grade player or better on tools. 
Wood was a divisive amateur prospect, with some scouts seeing him as a center fielder with elite raw power projection and others seeing him as an eventual first baseman with hit tool risk. He was unbelievable out of the gate as a Padres prospect; he only struck out 17% of the time at Lake Elsinore and hit .337/.453/.601 before the Padres traded him to Washington as part of the Juan Soto blockbuster, after which he hit .293/.366/.463. He did this amid multiple wrist injuries, which is something to keep in the back of our collective mind in the event that it becomes a chronic issue, as Wood's wrists are an integral part of keeping his swing short enough to be manageable. Hit tool cracks were more evident in 2023, as Wood struck out in 32% of his PAs and was especially flummoxed by changeups. He still managed to hit .262/.353/.520 with 62 extra-base hits. 
Because of how long-levered Wood is, it's likely he'll always strike out a lot, but he's surprisingly dangerous on the inner third of the plate for a guy of his build. He's shown flashes of covering high-and-away fastballs with power, as well as an ability to alter his posture to spoil soft stuff away from him, but he does neither of these consistently right now and those are the ways in which he's most vulnerable to whiffs. Once his wrist and forearms get stronger, he might be able to be a little shorter to the ball without sacrificing power. 
Wood is also surprisingly agile on defense. He takes a little while to get his legs churning, but once he's moving, he's a plus runner and has generated some home-to-first times in the neighborhood of 4.1-4.2 seconds. His huge strides enable him to cover a ton of ground in center field, and it's incredible that he not only has a chance to play there, but could be plus. Wood looks super smooth going into the gaps and approaching the wall. His poise and feel for center are both currently superior to Dylan Crews', but its much more typical for a compact athlete like Crews to stay up the middle for the long haul. Wood currently carries 240 pounds like a young Marcedes Lewis and is likely going to add weight commensurate with his frame as he matures, which might mean 30 pounds or more. The way that shakes out will have a significant impact on his defensive future. That said, Wood is already defying convention by looking as good as he does out there at his current size. In a lot of ways, Wood's report reads like a young Adam Dunn's, though we'd expect Wood to play better defense even if he ends up in an outfield corner. Admittedly a less stable hitter than a lot of the other elite prospects in baseball, Wood's ceiling is on another planet.","b32UDJr1jmk","sa3016870"
7,0,"Samuel Basallo","BAL","C","ST",2027,"60","High",,"19.5805555","6' 3""","230","L","R",2021,"Intl15","BAL",1300000,"Dominican Republic","Basallo was last year's ""Pick to Click"" who ""clicked"" the loudest, as the then-18 year hit .313/.402/.551, had 53 extra-base hits in 114 games and smooched Double-A in 2023. Basallo is a power-hitting kaiju catching prospect with Gary Sánchez's toolset — plus-plus power projection and arm strength, with some profound defensive flaws — except from the left side of the plate. Lackadaisically listed at 180 pounds, Basallo actually carries around closer to 230 pounds like a high school edge rusher prospect. He has preposterous bat speed and rotational athleticism for a hitter his size, let alone for a potential catcher. His peak exit velos (nearly 112 mph) and hard-hit rate (45%) are already plus on the big league scale, and this data was generated by an 18-year-old whose performance didn't dip at all after a month-long bump to High-A. He's swing happy and could stand to cover the outer edge of the plate a little better, but Basallo has the talent to be one of the best hitting catchers in baseball. 
With a full season of defensive reps under his belt, we have little better idea of what Basallo can and can't do behind the plate. His arm strength is incredible. Basallo routinely pops below 1.9 seconds, though like a lot of catchers his age, he could stand to be more accurate and consistent coming out of his crouch. His receiving is not good, but it isn't so terrible that it damns him to first base. His ball blocking might though, and it's this area of Basallo's game that most needs to improve. If this skill doesn't progress, or if Basallo's size quickly forces him to move out from behind the plate, then his issues with chase would suddenly become more of a problem, though we're probably still talking about a strong enough hit/power combo for Basallo to be an everyday first baseman. 
Basallo's chalk 40-man evaluation year is 2025. He's been promoted ahead of that pace so far, but it's pretty rare for catchers with his issues to be in the express lane to the big leagues. If the Orioles just want access to Basallo's bat and decide to fast track him as a DH, or proactively move him to first base knowing Adley Rutschman is in place as the franchise catcher for a while, then a late 2025 debut feels possible. If the Orioles want to give Basallo the best chance of having immediate success as a big league catcher, then he's more likely on a late 2026 or spring 2027 trajectory. There are few other prospects in the minors who have this kind of offensive ceiling and a chance to play a premium position.",,"sa3015716"
8,0,"Jordan Lawlar","ARI","SS","ST",2024,"60","Med",,"21.6527777","6' 1""","200","R","R",2021,"Draft","ARI",6710000,"Jesuit Prep HS","The highly touted Lawlar hit .263/.366/.474 in 89 games at Double-A Amarillo before he was quickly promoted up the rest of the ladder for a September call-up to Phoenix. The Diamondbacks only gave him about a week and a half of regular at-bats before Lawlar shifted into a pinch running and defensive replacement role down the stretch and on Arizona's playoff roster. They perhaps should have given him more runway to adjust to big league pitching with the hope that Lawlar could quickly become a more threatening hitter than Evan Longoria and Emmanuel Rivera were in October, but the Snakes was fighting for their playoff lives and didn't have the luxury to roll the dice. 
Lawlar posted career-best strikeout rates at Double- and Triple-A in 2023, but he still has a pretty grooved swing and his underlying contact data on the season is near the very bottom of the everyday shortstop population (73% contact rate, 81% z-contact%), so we're sticking to a below-average hit tool projection here. But Lawlar does everything else very well. He's a stellar shortstop defender with premium range and defensive athleticism. His throwing stroke to first base can sometimes look a little odd, but he finds all kinds of crazy ways to contort his body and send the baseball where it needs to go, which is especially true of his feeds to second base. He has rare power for a shortstop (let alone a really good defensive one), plus plate discipline, and what is approaching elite baserunning speed. Not only did Lawlar show top-of-the-scale sprint speed in the big leagues (not our favorite way of assessing runners, but still), but his swing's natural jailbreak, à la Rickie Weeks Jr., puts his home-to-first times in the 4.10 second range pretty regularly. His hit tool isn't enough of an issue to threaten the rest of his profile — Dansby Swanson's contact rates in 2023 were nearly identical to Lawlar's combined stats, but he plays great defense and hits for power, and Lawlar should too. 
With Eugenio Suárez now slated to play third base, a key spring development to monitor will be how the Diamondbacks integrate Lawlar into their lineup. Ketel Marte is not a good defensive second baseman and should DH a lot so Geraldo Perdomo can start at the keystone. Perdomo has more experience playing a variety of positions than Lawlar does, and odds are he will open the year as a sort of superutility type while Lawlar gets most of the starts at short. There may be a prolonged initial adjustment to big league pitching, but Lawlar is going to be a power-hitting star and another young, build-around guy who can help sustain Arizona's status as an NL contender.","2OR5zWimpHc","29976"

He was the top unsigned high schooler from the 2020 class, a toolshed who swung and missed on the summer showcase circuit more than teams felt comfortable with and ended up at LSU rather than in pro ball. He was immediately dominant as a freshman there, generating exit velos in excess of 100 mph on 17 of his first 30 balls in play and finishing with a .362/.453/.663 line that included 18 bombs. He followed that up by slashing .349/.463/.691 with 22 homers as a sophomore, before hitting .420/.567/.710 with 15 bombs and more walks than strikeouts as a junior. 
Crews can punish you to all fields. He'll get extended on fastballs away from him and crush them the opposite way, or he can turn on slower pitches on the middle two-thirds of the plate and hit some titanic blasts to left. At times, the depth of Crews' hand load will leave him late on fastballs. The bend and strength in his lower body is incredible, and he might be able to shorten up what he's doing with his hands and still get to huge power because of how special the rest of his operation is. He'll show you jailbreak-y, sub-4.1 run times, easily the speed to play center field, and his reads and routes (though still not great on balls hit in front of him) improved during his time in college after it first looked like he might be ticketed for right field. He sprints into the gaps with huge effort and is great at getting balls hit over his head. He should be an average big league center fielder, and his speed gives him bigger ceiling than that if his feel for the position continues to level up. Crews also does all kinds of little things well, be it procedural awareness on defense or how crisply he runs the bases. He's tooled up and has performed at the highest level of amateur baseball for three years, a layup top-two pick in basically any draft and likely a quick-moving, impact player in pro ball.","yuOejbqs8OA","sa3022882"

Changes to his delivery and physicality helped create a significant velo bump into the high-90s, as Skenes also made meaningful improvements to his arsenal of secondaries. The leap was so great that, in a fantastic draft class, nobody blinked that a pitcher went first overall. Skenes struck out 45% of the hitters he faced as LSU’s Friday starter, relying heavily on that fearsome upper-90s four-seamer (66% usage), which he consistently blew by his SEC opposition. While the heater was his pitch of choice during his final college season, he also made adjustments to his slider, which had previously been a north-south offering used largely for in-zone swing-and-miss. At LSU, his slider also added velocity and more horizontal sweep to make it a more effective out-of-zone weapon.
Skenes went on a tour of Pittsburgh's affiliates after the draft and threw a grand total of 6.2 innings in five starts. His changeup usage was elevated during that span, which is something to watch for in 2024. Skenes' low slot delivery creates a shallow angle on his fastball, but its tailing shape isn't great for missing bats. He throws so hard that it probably won't matter all that much, but most of Skenes' fastball swings-and-misses come to the arm-side part of the plate, rather than across the top of the zone like most modern power pitchers. It will probably be important for his changeup to develop to give him a pitch that plays off his fastball movement. On the sheer force of nature that his fastball and slider are, Skenes is ready to compete at the big league level even though he'll need to round out his repertoire to hit his front-end ceiling.",,"sa3023079"

He overpowered hitters with his fastball at the lowest levels, but by the end of the year, he was carving Double-A and looked like a fully-formed, four-pitch monster. He entered the spring of 2023 with a legitimate shot to break camp in the Phillies rotation, like a pitching version of Fernando Tatis Jr. a few years ago. Instead, Painter's elbow barked at him and he was shut down with a partial UCL tear after his first Grapefruit League outing. Painter and the Phillies opted for a plasma-rich platelet injection rather than an immediate Tommy John, which gave Painter a chance, with rest, to pitch at the end of a 2023 season in which the Phillies correctly anticipated that they'd be contenders. But Painter's elbow didn't heal completely from the PRP and rest, and he needed Tommy John toward the end of July; he isn't expected to pitch until 2025, per Dave Dombrowski. It's incredibly rare to value a prospect who will have missed two years this highly, but Painter has rare ceiling and the success rate of Tommy John surgeries is high enough to anticipate that he'll return to his old self. 
Healthy Painter has a prototypical pitcher's frame and then some, standing in at a broad-shouldered 6-foot-7 (which Painter has sculpted since his days as a high school prospect), a stature you'd more often associate with NBA wing players than pro pitchers. Doug Fister is a fair baseball body comp. Good luck getting on top of Painter's fastball when he locates it at the top of the zone. Even though he's so big and his pitches travel downhill toward the zone, it has still been hard for hitters to snatch his high fastballs, similar to the way Justin Verlander's fastball plays despite his size and release height. Painter will work six or more innings and never throw a fastball below 95 mph, sitting 96-98 for the bulk of the outing. 
Both of Painter's breaking balls have huge movement. His slider has two-plane sweep, while his curveball (more commonly used as an in-zone pitch and against lefties) is north/south and sometimes also has arm-side direction. If he can consistently create that arm-side finish on the curveball, it will give him a weapon against lefties. He had to whip out his changeup against upper-level hitters late in 2022, and some of those were quite good. Hitters seem to take more comfortable swings against his breaking stuff later in outings, so perhaps there's something about Painter's fastball angle that makes it easier for guys to see his breaking balls pop out of the hand once they've had a look at them. In a vacuum, though, he has a shot to have four plus pitches and an inning-eater's frame.

We stayed relatively low on Carter (he was one of the top 50-FV players at the end of last year) for a while, considering him more of a soft skills left fielder than a likely star, noting Brandon Nimmo as a potential comp who became exceptional. It looks like Carter is, too. We don't expect he'll perform to the level he did during his god-like call-up — .306/.413/.645 in September, .300/.417/.500 in the playoffs — but he'll produce enough to be a very good left fielder in the event Leody Taveras hangs around to play center for the foreseeable future. 
Carter's plate discipline is incredible, and his nerves of steel were on display during the 2023 postseason when he was very difficult for some of the best arms in baseball to make chase. He also has fantastic plate coverage and better ball-striking power on his more conservative swings than you'd expect from such a gangly and thin athlete. We don't think the league hasn't taken complete advantage of Carter's issues against breaking stuff yet, especially back foot breakers, against which he was vulnerable in the minors. Carter struggles to contact these pitches when they're well-executed (he actually had many more swings-and-misses than balls in play versus breakers in 2023), but he can punish the ones that don't quite finish. 
Defensively, Carter does some things very well in center field and some other things not so well. He’s great at running down balls in the gaps, and at finding the wall and then the baseball again as he approaches the warning track. His reads on balls hit in front of him aren’t as crisp (he'll make some diving plays in front of him that other center fielders make standing up), and his hands and ball skills are below-average. His arm plays above its raw grade because Carter’s exchange is so quick — he knows his best chance to hose someone is to get rid of the ball quickly and accurately, so he does. He’s definitely a fit in center field, but he isn't a Gold Glover or anything like that, and not as good as Taveras, which probably means Carter will be one hell of a left field defender for the next little while. Carter lacks the prototypical power of a starting left fielder, but his plate skills and speed are going to elevate his OBP enough to make him a very valuable player.","kn1p4E5tdTY","27790"

He ultimately fell to the White Sox at 22nd overall, and a little over a year removed from his selection, that looked like an absolute steal. Montgomery raked his way to Double-A in 2022, where he spent the last couple weeks of his first full pro season. His 2023 got off to a delayed start due to oblique and back issues that kept him on the complex in Arizona until July. Once he was back, Montgomery posted some of the best surface-level stats (.287/.456/.484 combined across all levels) and underlying TrackMan data in all of minor league baseball. His lack of chase (just 16%!), and the quality and amount of contact he made (8% swinging strike rate, 113 mph max exit velo just to name a couple data points) had Montgomery looking, on paper, like a near-ready superstar. 
We think there's rare plate discipline and power for a lefty-hitting infielder here, but we're fairly resolved that Montgomery won't be a big league shortstop defender, and we have some reservations about his hit tool. Montgomery did not look good playing shortstop late in 2023, though we suppose you could argue he looked the way he did because he was still recovering from injuries that may still have been impacting his mobility. We buy that there's variance around this evaluation, but most of what Montgomery is doing on defense happens too slowly, and runners end up safe on otherwise routine plays. His hands and range are both comfortably below average, and 21-year-olds this size rarely stick at short. Montgomery hasn't played anywhere but shortstop yet in pro ball, so we have him speculatively projected to third base, where guys his size tend to wind up. 
Skepticism that his hit tool is as good as his 2023 data performance comes in part from Colson feasting on low-level pitching for a large portion of his 2023 output. His swing is also long and cuts through the bottom portion of the zone. On tape and in the Arizona Fall League, Montgomery struggled with belt-high fastballs and with barrel accuracy in general. Again, the on-base skills and power here carry so much water that we think Montgomery will still probably be an above-average everyday corner infielder (unless he moves to first base), but this evaluation is probably a shade below the general industry consensus based on our eyeball scouting.","9ENOdU2g0cI","sa3017170"

But Anthony looked much better on tape as a center field defender in September than he did early in the 2023 season, and re-evaluating his defensive home makes a gigantic difference in the way he's projected overall because he can now have an offensive flaw or two and still be an impact everyday player. While he still isn't a true big league-caliber speedster or dynamic defensive outfielder, Anthony's long strides give him enough gap-to-gap range to play center field at an average level, and his reads and ball skills looked much better late in 2023 than they did when Anthony first transitioned from mostly right field to center in pro ball. 
Anthony's swing has become almost a carbon copy of Rafael Devers' cut, with a violent, mostly downward swooping bat path that relies on the bend in his lower half to go down and scoop low pitches with power like Devers does. While Anthony has shown some ability to do this (it's absolutely gorgeous when he does), he isn't doing so consistently. Opposing pitchers can limit his power by approaching him in the bottom half of the strike zone, as he tends to drive those pitches into the ground, and soft stuff precisely located down and away from him often eludes him entirely. Anthony slugged .466 at mostly Low- and High-A in 2023, but his expected slugging percentage based on his quality of contact was only .370; there isn't consistent lift and power here yet despite his surface level performance. Again, this was way more of an issue in our estimation of him when he was projected as a corner guy. The rest of Anthony's profile is pretty clean; he's tough to make swing and miss, he has fantastic bat speed, he already has big league-average raw power as he approaches his 20th birthday, and he's still physically projectable. 
Anthony's plate discipline evokes a baked good that has too much food coloring in it; there's an air of artificiality to it that makes it feel a bit unnatural. We hypothesize this because Anthony lets a lot of tasty pitches go right past him. One team we source data from tracks players’ “cookie swing rate”; in essence, the rate of swing when a pitch is right down the middle of the plate. Anthony's was among the lowest in the minors last year, and we think it speaks to an approach that includes premeditated takes rather than actual selectivity. We're skeptical his elite walk rates will continue as he sees more upper-level time, but the all-around offensive package here is still a big deal for a viable center fielder. Like Spencer Jones of the Yankees, we're projecting some on swing actualization and center field defense to get to this big time FV grade. Anthony will probably only kick down the door and force the big league issue if things click with his swing, and is probably on more of a late 2026 or early 2027 debut trajectory if they don't.",,"sa3020211"

Jones then focused solely on hitting. After an understandably rusty sophomore year in which it looked like the game was too fast for him, Jones moved from first base to right field and became a full-time starter in his junior draft season. He tweaked his swing throughout the spring and began to look more comfortable with the pace and difficulty of SEC baseball, as well as his gigantic body. The Yankees took him late in the first round and put Jones in center field, and he reached Double-A Somerset in a power- and strikeout-laden first full pro season. 
Jones has enormous potential, with eventual 40-homer power in the tank, and I think over time he's going to be able to shorten up and still get to enormous pop. His previous two-way prospect status, the pandemic, his college injuries, and Jones' outlier size are all ""tip of the iceberg"" traits that suggest late development. The hit tool is the key variable here. There is probably going to be an initial adjustment period against big league stuff, but the two-way Jones' stride length helps him galavant around center field with promise. He has rep-based projection there because he hasn't done it for very long, but at his size, it's entirely possible that he'll get too big and slow to stay there by the time his feel for the position improves to the big league standard. Even though his swing has been simplified, there is always going to be a ton of swing-and-miss here because of Jones' lever length. His 2023 whiff rates were only about one standard deviation worse than what's typical of a big league center fielder, with an overwhelming majority of his misses coming at the top of the strike zone and against backfoot breaking balls. He needs to be able to lift the ball more to actualize all of that power, which might mean further simplifying his cut. 
I don't expect any of this will come together in a hurry, and Jones is still more of a risky developmental prospect with a huge ceiling than he is ready for the big leagues. But as far as ceilings go, in this case we're talking about St. Patrick's Cathedral. Jones is on a post-2025 40-man timeline and has only had a cup of coffee at Double-A. He could feasibly spend most of the next two seasons at Somerset and Scranton because, again, there are clearly things he needs to work on at this stage. <em>So</em> much of this depends on whether or not the Yankees are contending, but for now I'd expect a late-2025 call-up (preserving all of his option years), with the huge impact not arriving in a consistent fashion until 2027 or so.",,"sa3019969"

He had a somewhat rocky first full season in pro ball; his velocity was down a bit compared to his peak pre-draft look and he ran a FIP over 5.00 across 18 starts with Lakeland. Hitters seemed unphased by Jobe's trademark curveball despite its elite spin and huge depth. He struggled to throw strikes and the visual quality of his stuff regressed. Then Jobe was put on the IL to start 2023 and missed two and a half months recovering from lumbar spine inflammation, which is more a description of symptoms than a root cause, as this kind of inflammation can be brought on by arthritis, infection, or any number of other maladies. When Jobe returned in mid-June, he did so with a vengeance. Across 20 starts combined between the regular season and the Arizona Fall League, Jobe tallied 103 strikeouts and just 11 walks in 79.2 IP. His fastball velocity was living in the upper reaches of his career-long band, often touching 98-99. 
Perhaps more significantly, Jobe has scrapped his curveball. He now utilizes a firm 87-92 mph cutter and a low-80s sweeper, and has upped his changeup usage considerably. Both of his new breaking balls have the same elite spin Jobe could create on his curveball, though neither of them has consistent shape nor finish yet. Considering he's only used those new pitches for half a season and can spin them like he does, I'm projecting growth for both offerings. His changeup is arguably his most switched-on secondary now, as Jobe uses it against both lefties and righties. The changes he's made in response to the ineffectiveness of his 2022 breaking ball have made Jobe a more complete pitcher. Will we see this kind of velocity from him across 120-140 innings? And will Jobe's back issues be a persistent part of his career? These are reasonable things to wonder, but right now Jobe looks healthy, nasty, and fairly ready to pitch in the big leagues. Jobe isn't on the 40-man yet (he doesn't have to go on until after the 2025 season) and the Tigers have a ton of starter depth in front of him right now, but it's feasible that at some point in the middle of 2024, he'll be one of Detroit's best five healthy starters.","Q_q_xGJX-bU","sa3018054"

Amador is one of those short-levered switch-hitters who is so short to the ball that he gets an extra beat to diagnose pitches before he has to commit to swinging, and he takes advantage of this. He's walked more than he's struck out every year of his pro career, and ran a microscopic 5% swinging strike rate in 2023. 
Over the past two years, Amador has thickened like a roux and become stronger, and while he's capable of doing more damage than our previous, tepid projection expected, he still doesn't have great power. A portion of his 2023 output was inflated by the hitting environment at Colorado's Spokane affiliate (all their affiliates are great to hit) and a portion of it was likely deflated by a broken hamate, which cost Amador about a month and a half of mid-season reps. Amador is now close to physically maxed out. Any leap he takes in power from here on out is going to come from improving his feel for loft, but his true raw power might have been masked last year because of the broken hand. He was still hitting a ton of choppers and grounders in Puerto Rico during winter league, only showing flashes of leaning on pitches with lift and power. His feel for the barrel and for the zone together should enable him to hit dozens of doubles at maturity, more so as a left-handed hitter. 
As he's gotten stronger, he's also gotten bigger and slower, and Amador's defensive projections have shifted from shortstop to second base. Some scouts are concerned about how thick he is for a 20-year-old and worry the sun may set on his athleticism sooner than the average big leaguer. We also have some long-term concerns about that, but Amador is such a precocious hitter that he'll likely be in the big leagues relatively soon and start his career long before that's an issue. A plus-plus hit tool on a middle infielder is a big deal, even if he's limited to second base. We'd love to see Amador maintain his superlative contact rates across a bigger sample in 2023 in order to feel greater resolve that his bat-to-ball skills give him an actual shot to be a star, but against lower level pitching it has so far.","WXd_Jl3PBO0","sa3014682"

In his first pro season, Horton played at three levels of the minors, with most of his innings coming at High-A, where he issued 65 strikeouts against just 12 walks in 47 frames. He finished the year at Double-A, where his strikeout rate dipped below 30% for the first time all season (but not by much), and he kept the ball in the ballpark for his entire stint with the Smokies. 
Horton's fastball sits 94-96 mph, occasionally touching 98, and he mostly pairs it with a vertical slider that sat in the upper 80s when he was in college, but now inhabits the 83-85 mph velo band. In college, left-handed hitters presented Horton with a significant stumbling block, to the tune of a .918 OPS in 2022, but he’s drastically increased his changeup usage against the lefties he’s faced as a pro (going from 7% to 17% when there’s a lefty at the plate) and their combined OPS in 2023 was just .533. The emergence of the changeup as a viable offering constitutes a meaningful addition to his arsenal.

A plus on-mound athlete with a great arm action and a carrying fastball that was in the 93-95 mph range, he was an exciting, tip-of-the-iceberg dev project for a Padres system that had recent success with two-way and conversion arms, most prominently Luis Patiño. Then the Dodgers plucked him away in a trade for corner role player Matt Beaty in late March of 2022, and we started to see parts of the iceberg that lay beneath the surface during Ryan's first full season as a pro pitcher. He was more in the 95-97 mph range throughout 2022 and was dominant (if a little wild) across just shy of 50 total innings. In 2023, Ryan held mid-to-upper-90s fastball velo under the stress of twice as many innings. He posted a 3.33 ERA in 97 innings with Double-A Tulsa before two Triple-A starts ended his year. 
In addition to the plus velocity, Ryan has two plus-flashing breaking balls in an upper-80s cutter/slider that he commands to his glove side and an 80-85 mph curveball with late vertical bite. Ideally Ryan will be able to refine his changeup over time. He's using it less than 10% of the time right now and its results aren't great, but he's a great athlete who is relatively new to pitching, so we're projecting on that offering. His curveball has enough depth to act as his go-to bat-missing weapon against lefties until his changeup improves. 
The visual report here is pretty ironclad. Ryan's build is a little bit more slight than the prototypical big league starter, but at 6-foot-2, he isn't small. He has sustained premium velocity over 100 innings of work, his breaking balls are plus to the eye and grade out as plus on paper, and his command is sufficient for Ryan to start and might continue to improve as he gets experience pitching. This is one of the better all-around pitching prospects in baseball, a pretty likely mid-rotation starter who might have significant skill development in his later 20s. It's plausible Ryan could be one of the best five starters in the org at some point in 2024 and make his way into the rotation, but there are currently so many suitable options already on the 40-man roster ahead of him that's it's more likely he gets his footing in the big leagues in 2025.",,"sa3016863"

While those changes may have been aimed at eliminating PCA's upper-zone swing-and-miss issues, they have instead resulted in a power surge over the past couple seasons the likes of which he'd never previously displayed. After sending out 16 bombs at Low- and High-A in 2022, he upped the ante in 2023 with 20 homers in roughly the same number of games, this time at Double- and Triple-A, where he was far younger than most of his competition. The upper- and outer-zone whiffs are still present, though, and while we think PCA is going to get to his power, it's likely that his hit tool and OBP skills will wind up comfortably below the big league average. 
But of course, PCA boasts some of the most electric center field defense in the sport and could be a nearly three-win player on that basis alone. His proficiency and fearlessness on the basepaths is undeniable – a significant portion of his doubles in 2023 were of the hustle variety – and as long as he's doing <em>something</em> offensively, he is going to be an impact big leaguer. He'll likely continue to be challenged by the upper-zone heaters that have long confounded him at the plate. If he can plug that hole over time, he'll be a five-tool superstar. More likely, he'll have some 20-25 homer seasons amid a ton of strikeouts and a low OBP, with peak years resembling Mike Cameron's (though almost certainly not to that level of annual consistency). With Cody Bellinger back in the fold, we expect it will be another year before PCA is truly entrenched as the everyday center fielder, though it's likely injuries will still cause him to play enough 2024 big league baseball to graduate from rookie status.","W3x5HtsbK0U","27769"

The Rays gave him a $2.3 million bonus to keep him from heading to Cal and have developed him solely at short. So far that looks to have been the correct assessment, as Williams has averaged 21 homers, 51 extra-base hits, and 24 stolen bases in each of his two full seasons of pro ball. In 2023, he slashed .254/.351/.506 at High-A Bowling Green, with a smattering of games at Double- and Triple-A as well. Then Williams had a no good, very bad Fall League stint in which he struggled mightily to parse breaking balls. He seemed totally gassed and very frustrated, the type of Fall League look you just kind of throw out. That's not to say that Williams is a lock to hit. He's struck out more than 30% of the time so far in pro ball and has severe breaking ball recognition issues that one optimistically wants to project on as Williams continues to develop as a position player only. But he already has such big power (his peak exit velos are a 55 or 60 on the big league scale and Williams is still a pretty skinny 20 year old) and defensive ability, especially for such an inexperienced player, that those two attributes will hold up his entire profile. 
Williams is an unbelievable athlete and flashy shortstop defender. He makes a lot of plays that no other shortstops do, as if his beginner's mind is conceiving of new ways to play the position. Occasionally into the upper-90s as a high school pitcher, Williams' arm rounds out a panoply of elite physical skills that project to make him a premium defender at short. Scouts are mixed as to whether Williams is actually projectable. Some scouts consider him a little too thin and frail looking to project on, but they are in the minority, and here we have WIlliams projected for impact power. His hit tool will probably cap Williams' ceiling somewhat and prevent him from being an elite all-around player, but his defense and power will make him an uncommonly good one.",,"sa3017795"

Abel still has most all of the ingredients needed to be an impact starter, he just isn't totally baked yet. The 22-year-old is still a lanky and projectable 6-foot-5, he has tremendous arm speed and bodily flexibility, and he'll occasionally touch triple digits (his fastballs averaged 96 mph throughout all of 2023) and show you plus secondary stuff, it's just that the timing of his arm swing and release varies too much for him to throw strikes consistently. This has been the case since he entered pro ball and it needs to improve for him to hit his ceiling, but for a 22-year-old built like Abel is, and who throws as hard as Abel does, this is not unusual or alarming. 
It is a little frustrating that some of Abel's blemishes have persisted for the last couple of years. His fastball shape isn't optimal, his slider would probably be nastier if it were harder and it often blends into Abel's curveball, and he still doesn't have great changeup feel. But Abel is freaky. His stride down the mound is huge, his hips, shoulders and upper back are incredibly loose and explosive, and all that energy ends up leaving his body through his fingertips and into the baseball. Ideally, he'll have functional four- and two-seam fastball variants at maturity and be able to work both north/south and east/west with his fastball. Abel has a strong natural proclivity for spinning his breaking stuff, but because his release is so inconsistent, so too is the shape and quality of those pitches. His mid-80s slurve is already an above-average pitch and could be a 70-grade shove machine at maturity. Abel will also flash a really good changeup once in a while; that pitch tends to be in the 86-89 mph range and feasts on hitters who have to cheat to catch up to his fastball. I'm projecting heavily on Abel's command in anticipation of him growing into his body and arm speed. If he can consistently locate his stuff, then Abel will be a front-end arm. If not, he's going to be a high-leverage reliever thanks to what I anticipate will be a 98-plus mph fastball if he's allowed to air things out one inning at a time.","Eqc625r-XdY","sa3014534"

In 2023, he slashed .290/.410/.564 across Double- and Triple-A at age 21. He executes a pull-and-lift approach geared for crushing mistakes in the upper two thirds of the strike zone, and Mayo has succeeded with this approach all the way up the minor league ladder despite his sometimes ugly looking cut, which has a strange, choppy stride. If most hitters' strides back toward the pitcher are ""outies,"" Mayo's is an ""inny"" — his front foot often lands closer to his rear foot than where it began in his batting stance. All of his swing's components fire in a short period of time, and it's an odd look, but it works for him. He does, however, swing inside a lot of sliders, even ones that don't completely turn the corner. Mayo's strikeouts will likely climb against big league pitchers who can exploit this, at least initially, but he's going to get to such big power that it probably won't matter. 
There is still a lot of work to be done on defense here, as Mayo's size makes it hard for him to move around at third base. Even though Mayo's bat has him on pace for a debut late in 2024, unless he looks good at first base (where he saw increased action after his promotion to Triple-A) or in right field (where Mayo has been speculatively projected here at FanGraphs for a while because of his max-effort arm strength) pretty quickly, he's more likely going to debut in 2025 barring trades involving the corner hitters nearing free agency ahead of him. Mayo projects to hit 35 annual homers, run a plus OBP, and consistently be one of the 10 most productive first baseman (or corner outfielders) in the game.","VSpXK_tYQAQ","sa3014479"

Kjerstad has monstrous all-fields power and enough feel for the barrel to weaponize it even though he tends to chase. His hands ignite in the blink of an eye, allowing him to turn on inside pitches with power and also to let outside pitches travel deep into the hitting zone before crushing them the other way. He has fantastic plate coverage but expands the zone too much, which is why he's projected as having a below-average hit tool here. 
Kjerstad is still going to have enough in-game power to support an everyday corner profile despite a potentially low OBP, and his defense has surprisingly improved. When he first returned from injury in 2023, it looked as though he'd end up in the 1B/DH bucket. But Kjerstad has looked more mobile and athletic as he's gotten farther away from his health and injury issues, and he now has average range and footspeed, though he still is not a very comfortable outfielder. It might take one more trade to clear the deck for Kjerstad to play every day. Ryan Mountcastle, Anthony Santander and Ryan O'Hearn are all in line ahead of Kjerstad, whose quickest path to playing time could be in a timeshare with Mountcastle and/or Austin Hays. Over time, he should be a homer-clubbing cleanup hitter on a contending Orioles team.","Kw_nkwAjQEs","31166"

He struggled against big league pitching during his six-week call-up at the end of 2023. Winn is not yet polished, especially on defense where he still mishandles a few too many routine plays. But he has the talent to play shortstop, his profile has a great bat-to-ball foundation, and because of his rare level of athleticism, the ceiling on Winn's power separates him from some of his contact-oriented middle infield peers. Winn looks like he's getting stronger and at the end of the year was swinging really hard. He was overmatched by big league pitching, but he's still just the age of a recent college prospect. His all-world arm will help make up for some of his defensive maladies (his hands aren't great) and, along with his speed, keep him at shortstop.

The southpaw throws from a low three-quarter arm slot and further lowers his release point by way of a deep knee bend as he lunges toward the plate. It’s a hard look to face from either side of the plate, in particular as a lefty hitter, and Harrison has earned praise throughout his minor league career for the results it has produced. Heading into the 2023 season, his career strikeout rate was 37.8% as he climbed from Low-A to Double-A, with opposing hitters confounded by his arsenal, which also features a vertical, slurvy breaking ball and a changeup that has steadily improved over the course of his career. 
Harrison started 2023 at Triple-A and spent most of the year there (minus a few weeks on the IL with a hamstring injury) before joining the Giants’ big league rotation in late August, where he finished out the season. During his time at Triple-A, Harrison somewhat underperformed the lofty expectations that his previous success at the lower levels had created. While his Triple-A strikeout rate was technically the lowest he’d ever posted, it was still in the mid-30s, which is hardly cause for alarm. But if the concerns surrounding his command had previously been mild throughout his career, they were ratcheted up to medium in 2023, with his Triple-A walk rate spiking to above 16%. Upon his promotion to the major league squad, Harrison managed to rein in his command and threw more strikes than expected, finishing his short big-league stint with a career-low walk rate (albeit over just seven starts). Still, his strikeout rate fell into the mid-20s and his HR/9 rose above two for the first time. He’s likely to stick in the Giants rotation to start the 2024 season, and with a larger sample, we’ll get a better sense for how he fits into that role, with the ideal outcome landing him in the middle of the rotation for keeps.","1AlmnfSq0xE","27758"

He spent most of the year at Double-A New Hampshire (with some rehab outings sprinkled in) before a Fall League stint that boosted his season-long innings total to 62. He’s yet to truly test his mettle as a professional starter, with the 78.2 innings he threw in 2022 representing his high-water mark thus far. While he's still on track for an impact starter role, there's an industry-wide desire to see Tiedemann prove he can hold his excellent stuff for 120 or so frames.  
When he has been healthy, however, Tiedemann’s stuff has indeed been excellent. He relies heavily on a wicked, mid-to-high-90s four-seamer thrown from a deceptively low lefty arm slot that keeps hitters in either batter's box uncomfortable. He primarily pairs it with a sweeper that has a boatload of horizontal movement, so much in fact that at times it's easy for hitters to lay off of it. This is a great strike-getting weapon because it starts in the lefty batter's box and finishes on the arm-side corner of the plate. Tiedemann's changeup is also pretty good, though more because his command of it has progressed; on pure stuff, it's only fair. You can get a detailed look at his delivery and pitches via the linked video. He already has two plus pitches and one that pretty comfortably projects to be above average, and with them Tiedemann posted a strikeout rate above 44% and a 1.68 FIP while holding opposing hitters to a batting average below .200 in 2023. 
Aspects of Tiedemann's delivery are unique in a way that makes him look reliever-y, but even if he ends up in the bullpen, he's going to be such a dominant reliever that he'll still belong about this high on a prospect list. He doesn't have to be put on the Blue Jays' 40-man until after the 2025 season, but especially if they feel like he can help them contend in 2024, it's possible Tiedemann kicks down the door and cuts his teeth at the big league level as a long reliever before transitioning back into the rotation down the line.","gi5o5UEm10g","sa3018096"

He barely played as a freshman due to the pandemic, and a broken foot ended his uneven 2022 junior year early. DeLauter crushed the Cape prior to his draft year and was shy of 21 years old on draft day, so it seemed likely model-driven teams were going to be all over him despite his weird looking swing (which at the start of 2022 was totally out of whack); it's unsurprising that Cleveland landed him in the first round. DeLauter didn't play pro ball after the draft and his 2023 got off to a delayed start because he had to have another surgery on his foot. He disemboweled High-A pitching once he returned (.366/.403/.549) and then looked great in the Arizona Fall League, where six weeks of watching DeLauter hit made it easier to believe in his swing. 
DeLauter's truncated finish through contact and the way his lower body interacts with his swing are both pretty weird to watch. He is adept at altering the posture of his body to manipulate the barrel around the zone rather than just do it with his hands. There's some risk he won't be able to do this as readily against major league velocity, which he really hasn't seen consistently yet. Even in instances where his swing isn't well-connected, he's strong enough to hit the ball hard somewhere. While he's best at golfing low pitches, DeLauter is also capable of taking ones on the outer third deep to the opposite field. His background contact rates (88% z-contact%) and lack of chase both reinforce the hitterish scouting look. It's tough to call a hitter who has only played about 60 games per year for the last four years ""stable,"" but from a skills and tools standpoint, DeLauter feels that way. He's tracking like a middle-of-the-order mainstay who'll first arrive in Cleveland late in 2025.",,"sa3021053"

His 2022 season was limited to 45 games by a wrist fracture and hamstring strain, and masked by the resulting small sample was subpar plate discipline, which became more evident in 2023 when Merrill was healthy and played more. Another body blow to Merrill's forecast is a looming slide down the defensive spectrum. Ha-Seong Kim and Xander Bogaerts are better shortstop defenders than Merrill, who has below-average hands. The Padres have many more question marks at corner positions than they do on the middle infield, and for the first time in his career, Merrill got reps at non-shortstop positions down the stretch in 2023 (mostly left field, with some first and second base); San Diego plans to experiment with him in the outfield in spring training. 
Let's not lose sight of Merrill's carrying tool, though: He can still really hit. He has one of the prettiest swings in the minors and a lovely all-fields approach to contact. He'll turn 21 early during the 2024 season, and it's feasible that Merrill will still come into more raw power as he matures, with some of his current oppo gap doubles turning into home runs. By virtue of his contact's precision, he might have peak years with 20 or so homers, and he's very likely to overcome his tendency to expand the zone and be a young core position player no matter where he ends up playing defense.","-JmCUHgebC4","sa3016829"

Mead missed nearly two months with a left wrist fracture, and his exit velos were down across the board even as hs slugged .515 in limited action at Durham (only 61 games). It's common for hitters returning from wrist injuries to experience a decline in power, so we're not sweating the underlying dip here. In fact, Mead also underwent a pretty significant swing change in 2023, one that incorporated more movement in his lower body, and it's remarkable that he performed as well as he did amid both the injury and the changes. We have this down as the second significant swing change for Mead in the last three seasons. 
Healthy Mead blends plus in-zone contact with above-average power. He's much more athletic in the batter's box than he is on defense, and the way his swing unwinds from the ground up is beautiful and violent. We also love how much his top hand is involved in driving the quality of his contact. Historically, Mead has raked despite having a hyper-aggressive approach at the plate. His swing decisions against fastballs were still pretty terrible in his small-ish 2023 sample but his breaking ball chase was fine. If he has at least learned how to parse breaking balls and fastballs from one another, he'll have leveled up his plate discipline enough to stabilize his entire offensive profile. 
Though the Rays deployed Mead at second base in their Wild Card round loss to the Rangers, we think he looked better at third base than ever before in 2023. He's still quite tentative making routine throws but his range has improved. Plus, he doesn't seem comfortable throwing back across his body, which second basemen have to do regularly but third basemen do not. An elbow sprain (which happened amid a throwing program to try to improve his arm strength) ended his 2022 and required a PRP injection, which is often a precursor to Tommy John for pitchers. That's a useful medical detail to file away but not something that's threatening Mead's profile. We aren't inclined to come off our 2023 grade for Mead because we think the reasons for doing so (his power looks pedestrian on a spreadsheet) are impermanent. He projects as an above-average everyday third baseman.","txl_FqwuORc","23986"

He immediately hit the ground running as a pro, putting up disgusting numbers on the complex and then leapfrogging to High-A, where he racked up a 197 wRC+ over 20 games before finishing the season with 15 games at Double-A. His numbers dipped slightly at the higher level, but he still performed well above the league average over his short stint in Tennessee, which is where he'll likely begin his 2024 season unless his performance as a non-roster invitee to spring training forces a more advanced assignment. It might. Shaw has looked quite electric this spring, if a bit chase prone.
Shaw's pro Trackman data last year was elite: He posted a 91% zone contact rate and plus peak exit velos. He's a powerful, short-levered hitter with really explosive wrists and a bit of an odd swing that, so far, has worked for him. His quick hands allow him to barrel up offerings throughout the zone, and he’s shown an ability to scatter hard contact all over the field. He's also a fast dead-ahead runner, though Shaw's lateral range on defense is not as good. Having stuck to the middle infield as an amateur, Shaw has now seen pro reps at all non-first base infield spots, including new work at third. With Nico Hoerner and Dansby Swanson entrenched on the middle infield, Shaw's fastest path to Wrigley could be through the hot corner. There has to be substantial development on defense before Shaw is a big leaguer, but he looks like an impact offensive player.",,"sa3022615"

Built like Jerami Grant, Alcántara's long limbs provide him with some natural power, but also sometimes make his swing hard to time correctly, especially against breaking balls below the strike zone. His lanky build also has plenty of room for added muscle, and the fact that he’s already a 20-homer guy while still having room on his frame for another 20 pounds or so portends a potent power profile down the line. Alcántara is so long-limbed that he'll likely always have swing-and-miss issues (they may get worse as he faces big league fastballs), and the fact that he's chase-prone doesn't help. He’s inconsistent in games, sometimes looking like a stud and other times looking somewhat uncoordinated and out of sync with his body. That's a pretty common problem for young hitters built like this, and we don't want to get fatigued with a player who has been on our Top 100 list since after his first pro season. Center fielders whose contact profiles resemble Alcántara's include Jose Siri, Michael A. Taylor, James Outman, and Jazz Chisholm Jr., guys whose performance tends to vary a lot year-to-year, and the same will likely be true of Alcántara. 
Importantly, he is a plus runner and is currently a defensive fit in center field. He's gotten very good at the minutiae of the position, like running to a spot and positioning himself to throw before he's collected the baseball. He'll probably need to sustain competence in center field in order to make this projection hold true, but we think he will. Alcántara wrapped 2023 at Double-A and then had a stint in the Arizona Fall League. The 2024 season will be his second option year. With Pete Crow-Armstrong entrenched ahead of him, it's possible that a combination of roster pressure and Alcántara's value to other teams (who think he can play center field) relative to the Cubs (who have PCA) put him in the crosshairs of a trade fit.","2sIOce13Y4M","sa3008752"

Throughout the season, his velocity not only climbed back into the 94-97 range that he had shown during the fall of 2021, but blew right past it, and Misiorowski was often up to 100 leading up to the draft. He sat in the upper 90s and touched 100 several times during the MLB Draft Combine, while also flashing a plus slider with huge length. He was ranked 24th on the FanGraphs draft board but fell all the way to pick 63. By the time he was pitching at 2022 instructs, Misiorowski had already added a second breaking ball to his repertoire and looked incredibly nasty, though whether he'd find the plate in any given outing was highly variable. That continued in a caricatured way in 2023, as Miz accrued 20 starts across three levels, totaled 71.1 IP, struck out 35% of opposing hitters, and saw his walk rate climb at each stop, culminating in a gnarly 15% BB% at Double-A Biloxi. 
Misiorowski's fastball averaged 97 mph in 2023 and touched 102. It was one thing to see him do that three innings at a time coming off prolonged rest during 2022 instructs, and another to watch him do it across 70 innings. He gets way down the mound and creates tough angle on his fastball at the top of the zone. His breaking balls also have elite quantifiable movement. His curveball bends in around the 82-85 mph range with gigantic lateral wipe, while his slider is more likely to be 84-87 mph. So many of Miz's breakers are nowhere near the zone, and they generated a slightly below-average chase rate for a slider because hitters weren't biting. 
Misiorowski still hasn't totally grown into his long-limbed body and has way below-average release consistency and command. Lots of scouts and clubs were very fearful he was a relief-only prospect before he was drafted and that's still the case. You can't walk as many hitters as Misiorowski has and be a reliable big leaguer, let alone a star, but as a JUCO prospect with just one year of pro instruction so far, there is huge developmental projection here, as well as the physical characteristics you're looking for in an impact arm. The power and balance of his lower half is remarkable and at a loose 6-foot-7, Miz has the frame to withstand a starter's workload as he adds strength. Obviously we're projecting substantially on Misiorowski's ability to command the baseball for him to grade out this highly. His ceiling as a reliever is big enough that this ranking might be correct even if he never throws enough strikes to start.","eL000Q5EAxA","sa3020644"

Over the course of the 10 starts he did make, he allowed just four earned runs (all in the same game) and handily outmatched his Low-A opponents, who put a mere 13 balls in play while posting a measly .148/.179/.148 line. He pulled this off thanks to a mid-90s fastball and a devastating 79-82 mph horizontal slider that consistently sent confused bats a-flailing. The fastball/slider combo was more than enough to make Schultz stand out in 2023, and if he can improve on the consistency of his changeup, which currently flashes above average and saw an uptick in usage toward the end of the season, he could unlock a more robust arsenal and add to the impact of his slider. 
His height, build, arm slot, and slider quality (seriously) have inspired inevitable comparisons to famed photographer Randy Johnson, though it’s far too early to hang such expectations on a 20-year-old with just 27 professional innings. His slider <em>is</em> that nutty, though. Schultz has filled out physically since being drafted, which is promising in terms of his durability and arm strength, but his season nevertheless came to an abrupt end when he went on the IL with a left shoulder impingement in mid-August. We want to see Schultz demonstrate starter durability before absolutely stuffing him on our overall prospect list, but he has the talent to be one of the top couple of pitching prospects in the sport if he can sit 94-95 like this across 120-plus innings.","hb_PKzm1MTQ","sa3020949"

He has sublime feel for contact and can really run, presenting the Tigers with an old school leadoff hitter's profile as he enters pro ball. 
With barrel control well beyond his years, Clark has rare hit tool projection for a high school prospect, spraying flush, all-fields contact with remarkable consistency. Though his swing doesn't feature big lift and Clark lacks overt, frame-based power projection, the amount of contact he makes and its quality should enable him to hit for plenty of in-game power in pro ball — it will just likely manifest as 40 or 50 doubles rather than 30-plus home runs. 
Clark has Corbin Carroll's high school skill set with something closer to a prototypical major league build and more present physicality than Carroll had at the same stage. It's not as though Clark is put together like high school Manny Machado or Ken Griffey Jr., but he's sinewy and strong, especially in his lower half. While some weight room warriors (like Spencer Torkelson and Jarred Kelenic) may have gotten so muscular and stiff that they began to have problems dipping to contact pitches low in the strike zone, Clark's natural barrel feel should help mitigate this. He has special hit tool projection and speed, the latter of which should help enable him to stay in center field even though his feel for the position is only fair. Clark projects as an everyday center fielder whose pathway to superstardom is dependent on him either developing more home run power than I expect, or having elite plate discipline and on-base ability. He chased so infrequently after the draft that I believe the latter scenario stands a better chance of happening.","yt4_ilKyXhE","sa3022683"

He struggled very badly with strikeouts upon return, but he cut his Ks down to 20% after the All-Star break and hit .260/.451/.487 the rest of the season, which includes five weeks at High-A Greensboro. More impressive was that he nearly matched his strikeout total with walks. By the end of the season, Johnson’s 21.9% walk rate across Low- and High-A was the highest of any minor leaguer with as many at-bats as he accrued. As that would imply, Johnson kept his chase rate in check at both levels, though his patience bordered on passivity, with a swing rate below 39%. 
There is a lot of swing-and-miss happening here, more than we projected when Termarr was coming out of high school, because his swing is so completely geared for power that he sometimes corkscrews himself into the ground. Termarr has a lot of juice, and after he looked like a slap hitter at times during his 2022 debut, he clubbed 18 homers in 2023. He has huge offensive upside for a middle infielder, especially if the power can be combined with a high OBP. We thought Termarr could have played a passable college shortstop and that he might be developed there initially as a pro, but instead he's played second base almost exclusively and he's flashy, if a bit uneven there.

Rodriguez has absurd plate discipline rivaling that of org-mate Edouard Julien (chase rate below 20%, virtually no uptick with two strikes), as well as plus-plus measureable power (108 mph 90th% average), which is amazing at age 20. 
Rodriguez can also really go get it in center field. His reads, routes, instincts and ball skills in center are all spectacular, and right now he has the foot speed to play there. ""Right now"" is key, and this is where Rodriguez's profile takes a bit of a turn and becomes difficult to wrangle. Rodriguez is a stocky 5-foot-10, 215 pounds or so already at age 20. He glides around the outfield with ease but whether that will still be true even three or five years down the line is not guaranteed because his body is already maxed out. In many of Rodriguez's swings you can see his stiffness, especially in his hips, which is atypical of impact career big leaguers. His compact build and short levers allow Rodriguez to turn on inside pitches with huge power, but he struggles badly to get on top of fastballs up and away from him, and his contact rates are near the bottom of the big league scale. It's hard to predict how long some of Rodriguez's skills will hold water, specifically his power and defense. 
There are a lot of Trent Grisham similarities here in terms of Rodriguez's build, elite minor league walk rates, and hit tool issues. Grisham has hit below the Mendoza line each of the last two seasons, and his contact rates both overall and in the strike zone are better than Rodriguez's were in 2023. James Outman, who presents a more traditional athletic look but has similarly poor contact skills, is another okay comp to feel good about projecting Rodriguez this strongly despite what will probably be a hit tool near the bottom of the scale.","-XltguAldkY","sa3014693"

After he destroyed High-A for just 20 games at the end of 2022, the Brewers sent Quero straight to Double-A in 2023, and he responded by slashing .262/.339/.440 and upping his previously concerning walk rate to 10%. He also more than doubled his previous career home run total by swatting 16 of them, though Biloxi and many Southern League ballparks tend to inflate homers. 
Quero gets right on top of the plate and is looking to pull the ball in the air as much as possible. He is best at snatching fastballs up around his hands and lining them down the left field line, which is how he does most of his extra-base damage. This approach can leave him vulnerable to stuff on the outer edge, which he sometimes struggles to even reach, but so far it was worked for Quero, who has never struck out more than 19% of the time at any minor league level. Quero's 85% in-zone contact rate would be top 10 among big league catchers, but his overall contact rate is more toward the middle of that position group because, despite his uptick in walks, Quero is still pretty chase-prone. His swing rates (56-57% the last two years) are way up there with the Mario Felicianos, Francisco Mejías and Jorge Alfaros of the world, predecessors whose monster tools have been severely undercut by their voracious approaches. Yainer Diaz had a rock solid 2022 debut with similar rate stats, and Quero is a better defender than Mejía (identical rate contact stats), so we can project him north of Mejía's outcome pretty comfortably. 
Quero can get caught in between whether he wants to block or backhand pitches in the dirt to his right, but otherwise he's a good defensive catcher, especially for a 21-year-old. He has a plus arm and routinely pops below 1.9 seconds, and his receiving and pitch framing are much better than most college-aged catchers. He's now on Milwaukee's 40-man and is a good enough defender that they should feel comfortable with him getting big league time in 2024 if anything happens to William Contreras or Gary Sánchez. Long-term, he projects as a primary catcher, though Contreras' emergence might complicate things.","Q5KxKyggNws","sa3015407"

He looked heavy and haggard during the 2022 Arizona Fall League after a long and eventful year during which he played some winter ball for Gigantes del Cibao, saw 520 regular season plate appearances, changed organizations as the highest-profile prospect in the blockbuster Luis Castillo deadline deal, went to Germany as part of Team Spain's WBC qualifier roster, and then came back to the US and played for another six weeks in the Fall League. He looked rejuvenated in 2023 and slashed .279/.358/.454 split between Double- and Triple-A before debuting to the tune of a .316/.366/.456 line in 123 major league PAs. Marte continued to look svelte in the D.R. during the winter until he pulled a hammy. As of Top 100 publication time he isn't running at full speed as camp begins, but assuming he recovers for Cactus League action, he'll be part of a host of exciting young hitters competing for an Opening Day lineup spot in Cincinnati. 
Marte is a fairly skilled hitter with good plate coverage, only really whiffing a bunch against well-executed sliders, which is true of most hitters. Though he's incredibly physical and has above-average raw power already at age 22, Marte's swing is not actualized for power. He tends to cut down on the baseball and can really only elevate hanging breaking balls and pitches toward the top of the strike zone. Some of this is caused by Noelvi's swing path and some of it is caused by imprecise feel for sweet spot contact; Marte hits a lot of choppers and grounders even though he doesn't whiff all that much. He's still a well-rounded player who looked as engaged and agile on defense in the big leagues as he ever has. He projects as an everyday third baseman with a shot to be a more impactful player if he finds a way to get to his power more consistently.","CEY7xdrO7zA","26517"

Knee and hamstring surgery effectively knocked him out for the 2020 season, then Lee raked in his sophomore and junior years with a great Cape Cod stint sandwiched in between. Before the 2022 draft there was again industry buzz that some teams were off Lee because of his medical, and he fell deeper into the draft than is typical for a college shortstop with his statistical track record. 
Minnesota sent Lee to High-A almost immediately and he raked there, then had a very solid first three months of 2023 at Double-A Wichita before his performance and visual scouting look fell off late in the year at Triple-A St. Paul. There was a definite physical regression for Lee, who looked a little less trim and rangy than he did in 2022. Because of his size (Brad Miller is a fair body comp), straight line speed (he's heavy-footed from home to first, in the 4.5s) and his medical, clubs have tended to project him to third base, and Lee began to see time there about once a week after he was promoted to St. Paul. Our projection has always been a little more bullish about him staying at short, at least for a while, largely based on Lee's great feel for the position. He has quick actions and is adept at positioning his body to be ready to throw as he fields the baseball, his transfer is quick, and his internal clock is well-calibrated. He finds creative ways to make timely, accurate throws, and even though it sometimes looks awkward and like he is making the play harder than it needs to be, Lee makes a lot of fun, flashy plays for a bigger dude. We're less certain about his shortstop projection now than we were a year ago because he looked less mobile later in 2023. It's possible he was just gassed from playing many more games than he had before, or it's possible Lee is more permanently outgrowing the position like a lot clubs anticipated prior to the draft. 
Lee was also a little more chase-prone in 2023, especially after he was bumped to St. Paul, where his swing decisions on fastballs were particularly bad. He's still capable of moving the barrel all over the strike zone and makes lovely, all-fields contact. A lot of Lee's underlying data is still pretty strong, especially his 87% in-zone contact rate and his expected batting average and wOBA based on contact quality. It's not such excellent hit data that we're ignoring Lee's pimply 2023 altogether — his grade has been down-shifted here — but he continues to project as an average everyday player even if that's as a good-gloved third baseman.",,"sa3019973"

Wicks has a vertical arm slot that helps his fastball play as a bat-misser at the belt by imparting ride on the pitch. He's also added an upper-80s cutter to flesh out the middle part of his velocity range. As noted in our previous write-ups, the lefty-with-a-changeup-and-command combo is one that tends to at least earn a spot at the back of a starting rotation, and Wicks has now added a host of different breaking balls to go with it. He's been a low-variance Top 100 prospect for a couple of seasons now, as we expect he'll hold down a no. 4 role on a good team.

He went 15-0 in 17 starts for Wake Forest prior to the College World Series and posted a sub-1.00 WHIP and sub-2.00 ERA, then did not pitch at an affiliate after the draft. He brings mid-90s heat, a plus-plus slider, and a potentially plus changeup to the party, and could be a mid-rotation option in Cincinnati by the middle of the 2024 season. 
Lowder's best pitch is his upper-80s slider, which has considerable length for a pitch that hard. The sink/tail action of his fastball limits its bat-missing ability in the strike zone, but its movement pairs nicely with his slider and it's hard for hitters to cover both of those pitches when they're located well in sequence. Lowder's fastball also has utility running back over the glove-side corner of the plate, and he might be able to accentuate the sink on his fastball over time. His fastball/slider combo is very similar to Brady Singer's coming out of Florida, but Lowder's changeup has much more natural action and movement than Singer's did. If he can refine his command of that pitch, he will have a second consistent bat-misser to go with the slider. 
A gangly, unspectacular athlete with a theatrical, cross-bodied delivery, Lowder clearly works hard to keep his somewhat awkward frame in great shape. His bow-legged front side and the stiffness in his hips and lower back contribute to a funky operation that aids in deception, but is an atypical look for a big league starter. He's a high-floored, quick-moving mid-rotation starter who could contribute to a run at the NL Central crown in 2024.",,"sa3023360"

With so many other infielders also in the upper-level mix for playing time, chiefly Gunnar Henderson and Jackson Holliday, the Orioles traded Ortiz as part of a package for Corbin Burnes. His profile was initially rooted in his plus combination of defense and feel for contact, but in 2023, he traded some of that contact for meaningfully more power. Ortiz’s underlying contact quality took a leap across the board, most notably his hard-hit rate, which rose from 31% in 2022 to 46% in 2023. This was coupled with a noticeable shift in his physicality, as Ortiz looked bigger and stronger. Ortiz’s contact rates, both overall and in-zone, dropped a tad compared to 2022 and he’s a bit chase-prone, but his well-rounded offensive output should clear the relatively low bar for middle infielders. 
While a capable shortstop, Ortiz is not quite the defender that Willy Adames is. Unless Adames is also traded, Ortiz is more likely to wind up playing second base, where he is an exceptional, Gold Glove-caliber defender. His range and acrobatics are rare for that position. If not for Rhys Hoskins’ presence at first base, Milwaukee’s current projected group of Adames, Ortiz, and Brice Turang would be one of the best infield defenses in baseball. Ortiz projects as an everyday middle infielder at either position and is talented enough to be a part of Milwaukee’s core for the next half decade.","oLEMiIO78pw","25493"

Teams mostly understood his commitment to ASU to be pretty loose, and Keith signed for an over-slot $500,000 as a fifth rounder in the 2020 draft. Injuries limited him during his first two full seasons in the Tigers org, but he mashed when he played. He looked great during the 2022 Arizona Fall League, then clubbed nearly 70 extra-base hits in 126 games throughout a fully healthy 2023 split between Double- and Triple-A. During his stay in Toledo, Keith began to see more time at second base rather than his native third. He's a bad defender at both spots but has a much greater chance at becoming passable (read: hidden) at second, where some of Keith's issues with throwing are masked. 
Keith's offensive prowess is rooted in his raw power. He nearly killed managing editor Meg Rowley and her laptop in the auxiliary press box during his Futures Game BP when two or three of his dingers clanged off the face of the deck above her. Keith clocks fastballs well and is short to the top of the strike zone. He struggles with soft stuff in the bottom third of the zone, especially changeups, which he tends to swing over the top of. This will likely prevent Keith from being a plus contact hitter, but I don't view him as being so risky in this regard that it threatens his whole profile. He's a flawed player and his WAR output will be impacted by his lack of position, but Keith is going to slug enough to profile as either a DH or bad-gloved second baseman.
Keith has bulked up considerably since signing, and the effects of his increased size are evident on defense. Once a fair bet to stay on the middle infield, he is now fighting just to stay at third. He is stiff and bulky, his actions are well below average, and while he shows you a big arm when he gets to wind up and really let it eat, he struggles to throw from odd platforms. It's feasible a team could live with him playing third base situationally, but it's not ideal, and Colt is a 30-grade defender right now. He is similar to Nolan Gorman in the way he has trended athletically on defense, but there's enough bat to support an everyday fit at the bottom of the defensive spectrum. Despite the underwhelming defensive forecast, Detroit clearly likes what they have in Keith: In January, the Tigers signed him to a six-year, $28.6 million extension with three club options and incentives that could push it's value to $82 million.","XpRBXuPDNN8","sa3014474"

He still has some warts, which I'll talk about in a second, but his overall offensive ability should provide enough impact for him to break the profound University of Arizona hitter drought the game has experienced since Scott Kingery's swoon. 
Wells' swing is beautifully connected from the ground up. The blend of his barrel control and the natural lift in his swing gives him a potent contact and power combination, which will likely make him a valuable hitter even if he ends up being unable to catch. His peak exit velos weren't incredible in 2023, but Wells was working back from a rib injury that may have sapped his explosiveness. In the past, I've been concerned about his inability to make contact with fastballs running up and away from him, but he wasn't as helpless against them when you put on his tape from late in 2023 tape. Anyone with a swing as uphill as Wells' is going to swing underneath a lot of fastballs in that location, but he snatches his fair share of them and is dangerous enough in this part of the zone to alleviate some of my past apprehension. More of a problem during his big league stint toward the end of 2023 was Wells' tendency to chase and swing over the top of changeups. Wells was a steady 11% (or better) walk rate guy in the minors, but he seemed to be pressing during his cup of coffee. I'm inclined to bet that his true skill level is closer to his historical norms. 
Even an average hit/power combination would be a big deal if Wells can remain a catcher. Ever since a severe shoulder injury he suffered in high school, Wells has had issues throwing out runners. Runners have had a 82% success rate against him in pro ball (343 total stolen bases in 308 pro games). His pop times are fine (1.90 during his big league trial per Baseball Savant), but his footwork is inconsistent as he leaves his crouch, causing inaccurate throws. This issue needs long-term attention, but Wells has made considerable progress as a receiver and ball-blocker despite his below-average hands and limited lateral mobility, the result of his one-knee style. I'm now more bullish than I've ever been about him staying behind the dish. It looks like the Yankees might carry three catchers on their big league roster, which would give them the flexibility to catch Wells when the starting pitcher is good at holding runners and give him some run in left field on other days (he played left a little bit in college). This is a great way to get Wells' feet wet as a big league defender while also getting his bat into the lineup regularly, but ideally he'll improve enough as a thrower to simply be the primary catcher for the better part of the next half decade.","nze40aRSOeo","27562"

Jung seemed gassed after the draft and hit just one homer in 30 games, but his power output exploded in 2023; he clubbed 28 homers, half of them in just 47 Double-A contests during the last month and a half of the season. After 128 regular season games, Jung was sent to the Arizona Fall League, where he played third base. Since his sophomore year of college he had only played second base, and while he's a capable pivot man on double plays, Jung is otherwise a below-average keystone defender. Some of what Jung struggled with at second base will follow him to third, but his lack of footspeed will be less of an issue, and Jung's arm looked suited for the left side of the infield during his Fall League trial. Ideally Jung can be capable enough to shuttle back and forth between both spots. 
Jung is dangerous all over the zone. He can crush pitches on the outer third into the oppo gap, and he'll hit some epic pull-side homers. His swing has big, aggressive launch and he has enough feel for the barrel to weaponize it, though his style of hitting does cause him to whiff quite a bit in the strike zone. He does skilled, hitterish things in order to slug, but because of his style, Jung is likely to make below-average rates of contact. Ryan McMahon, or perhaps the last few years of Max Muncy (without such good plate discipline), is a good barometer for what to expect from Jung: a below-average infield athlete who trades a little bit of contact to get to huge power. Jung is talented enough to win a job at some point fairly early in 2024. The newly extended Colt Keith is a second base-only fit if he's going to play the infield at all, which would force Jung to third. Though flawed, Jung should slug enough to produce like a 2-ish WAR player annually and be a core build-around guy in Detroit.",,"sa3019992"

As a high schooler, he was among the more polished shortstop defenders in his class and was performing well from a bat-to-ball standpoint on the showcase circuit. He looked like a high-floor middle infield prospect with a modest ceiling. His upper body has become much stronger, and Young has traded some contact for power, while his increased size has detracted from his defense and has made it more likely that he ends up at to second base as he climbs the minors, though he's still mostly playing shortstop now. His hands and exchange are still good, but his arm is not and his future range might not be, either. 
The good news is that Young is a very well-rounded offensive player whose OBP skills and burgeoning power will profile at the keystone. Though he sometimes struggles to cover the high-and-away portion of the zone, he otherwise has great plate coverage and a patient approach. Most of his in-game power is currently isolated to lower pitches, which Young sprays all over the field. His surface-level SLG from 2023 (Young hit .277/.399/.449 combined in the Cal and Northwest Leagues) was above his current true talent level, but across parts of two seasons he now has an incredible .402 career OBP.

He is also capable of playing a couple of spots on the infield, though not nearly as well; unless his plate discipline is so terrible that he shifts into a premium utility role, he is probably just going to play center field all the time. 
Even at 23, Rafaela still has a sinewy, projectable frame. He's hit 21 bombs each of the last two seasons and we project he'll add another half grade of power in his mid-to-late 20s. Whether he'll get to that power is another matter — Rafaela is a very aggressive hitter who has chased at a 40% clip each of the last two seasons.

For starters, Ramos is an astounding low-to-the-ground athlete whose powerful legs facilitate spectacular feats on offense and defense. He has plus range and is capable of making strong throws from all kinds of awkward body positions. The White Sox have tried Ramos some at second base, but we think the ceiling on his third base defense is big enough that they should just let him play there. For whatever reason, Ramos airmails routine throws more than is typical of a big league third baseman, or he at least misses enough to pull the first baseman off the bag and make things more interesting than they need to be. He has the physical ability to be a plus or better defender, but we'll stop short of projecting him as such as long as this issue is present. 
Similarly, Ramos has one specific offensive flaw that will require adjustment to remedy. His hands load late (there's a little wrap, and he's still separating while the pitch is in flight), and he is too long back into the zone to compete with fastballs around his hands. He's easily at his best when he's fully extended on pitches away from him. We love how loose and explosive Ramos' hitting hands are through contact, though. His best swings are some of the prettiest righty cuts of any prospect in baseball, and Ramos is capable of doing huge all-fields damage because of his strength and bat speed. He's also a discerning hitter. While a groin injury shelved him for the first month and a half of the 2023 regular season, thus limiting his data sample somewhat, Ramos barely chases and has especially steely nerves with two strikes. Many hitters have higher chase rates with two strikes than their all-count chase, but Ramos' holds steady at an excellent 26%. There are going to be some pitchers whose fastballs live in Ramos' Forbidden Zone, and they'll be able to get him out at will if they can execute around his hands (barring an adjustment), but otherwise Ramos projects as a dangerous and exciting young position player the White Sox can build around.","mR7nu6u00Tk","sa3010024"

So far in pro ball, Gilbert is performing more like a do-everything player with a balanced hit and power skill set, and just enough center field defense to project there in the big leagues. He reached Double-A with Houston during the first half of 2023, then was traded to New York as part of the Justin Verlander deal and slashed a fantastic .325/.423/.561 during his post-trade time with Binghamton. 
Gilbert has gotten stronger since signing (he was already yoked) and takes a mighty rip for a 5-foot-9 guy. He is a very dangerous low ball hitter, capable of tracking and adjusting to breaking balls mid-flight. When Gilbert collapses his back side and leans on one, he'll show you emphatic pull-side lift, and he does most of his extra-base damage by yanking doubles down the right field line. While Gilbert shows some other hitterish characteristics with the occasional oppo liner, he is less of a bat control master than he is just a twitchy, short-levered hitter who is tough to beat because of how concise his swing is. His barrel is in the zone for a long time and he tends to find a way to put the ball in play, using his strength to muscle balls past infielders. He made what is roughly an average rate of contact for a starting big league center fielder in 2023, but also hit the ball harder than expected. It'd be surprising if Gilbert hit 25-plus annual bombs, as pitchers can stay away from him and limit his power, but he's going to ambush 18 or so and hit a ton of doubles, which is great for a capable center fielder.
A plus runner, Gilbert can go get it in center field and has a great arm. His range is fine, but his hands and ball skills aren't the best, and there are some scouts who think he'll be plus in a corner rather than stick in center. Gilbert plays with an edge, the kind of guy you love to have on your team but hate to play against, with his on-field persona toeing the line between ""fiery"" and ""excessively abrasive.""

In a bodily sense, he was also unlike any amateur prospect most scouts had ever seen. Built at age 16 like a late-20s Mike Trout, nobody was totally sure how Domínguez's body and physicality would develop as he entered his 20s, and this (plus the internet hype) was what made him similar to Zion. Domínguez's pro career got off to a delayed start because of the pandemic, which clouded the outlook for his hit tool even more than is typical for a risky amateur prospect like this. After some initial struggles in 2021, especially from a contact standpoint, Domínguez quickly climbed through the minors and reached the big leagues late in 2023 as a 20-year-old. He showed his trademark power during an eight-game stint before his UCL blew out. He had Tommy John late in September and is slated to miss nine or 10 months, which puts him on pace to return in June or July of 2024. 
Domínguez's impact power is the tool that floats his prospect boat. He has incredible strength and bat speed for a hitter his age, and he's forecast here to slug enough to make up for other ills. Domínguez is not yet an especially comfortable or smooth outfield defender, and he doesn't have great feel for the barrel from either side of the plate. Which of Domínguez's skills should we continue to project on? I don't want to project on his power as much as I normally might for a 20-year-old because his frame is already maxed out. In fact, Domínguez's bulkiness makes me want to project a near-term regression in foot speed. If Domínguez is going to be an impact player, then his feel for either center field or for contact needs to improve. I think the former is more likely, considering how few reps he's had there in pro ball. It will be important for Domínguez to stay as lithe and fast as possible during his TJ rehab to give him a better chance of remaining at a premium position, where his rather extreme power-over-hit skill set has the best chance to profile.","x6cbWcITk7Q","28080"

He then dominated A-ball in his first full pro season before he looked overmatched during a late-season cup of coffee at Double-A Binghamton. Williams posted walk rates near 20% at Low- and High-A, hit 13 homers and stole 44 bases in 115 games, and forced his way to the upper levels while still just 19 years old. He is a plus athlete, a 70 runner, and a short-levered gap-to-gap hitter who has the catalytic qualities of a dangerous leadoff man. 
It's too soon to call him a do-everything, five-tool prospect, but Williams isn't far off. He has a sizable hole in his swing at the top of the strike zone, which is atypical of a compact hitter like this. But his feel for the strike zone is excellent, his hitting hands are super explosive, and Jett can adjust to breaking balls by bending in his lower half in a way that is rare even for good hitters. I do think the belt-high hole in his swing is more likely to be exposed in a meaningful way now that he's reached the upper minors, but the power and OBP combo here will still be enough for him to profile as an everyday player. 
He also has more developing to do on defense. Williams is athletically capable of playing all three up-the-middle positions but requires polish. In 2023, he played shortstop most of the time and got a start in center field about once a week. The reliability of his hands and arm strength are both on the fringe of what's viable at short. Williams simply mishandles the baseball too much to be a good shortstop right now and doesn't have a ""from the hole"" cannon. He is such a rangy, high-effort athlete that I consider him a ""maybe"" long-term defender there, and the makeup report on Williams indicates he's going to work to improve in the areas he's lacking, but young prospects whose defensive scouting reports read like his at the same age (the Roman Quinns and Billy Hamiltons of the world) tend to end up in center field. Even though Williams played once a week in center, whole games would pass without him seeing any action out there. His reads and routes are not comfortable yet, but his speed and ability to adjust when he has to flip his hips and change directions is incredible. While it might be more valuable for Williams to stay at short, I think his chances of becoming a special defender are greater if he and the Mets commit to center field. He projects as an impact up-the-middle player even though the specifics of the defense are still cloudy.",,"sa3020134"

Tightly wound and muscular, Ford looks incredible during BP and has crude but effective feel for contact in games. He's kept his strikeout rates to a manageable level even though he has an obvious hole in his swing at the top of the strike zone, and he's also a very discerning hitter with precocious feel for the zone. His offensive tools give him the chance to be an impact player if he can remain at catcher. 
When Ford was drafted, he needed a lot technical development behind the plate. Indeed, he was so raw that there was talk of him being drafted as a center fielder. He has tweaked some aspects of his defense and is now catching on one knee. His hands and receiving began to improve during his first full season, and his ball-blocking took a step forward in 2023. With a huge arm spearheading his defensive profile, Ford now looks like a pretty solid bet to catch. 
His power was somewhat absent in 2023, at least under the statistical hood. Ford hit 15 homers during the 2023 season but had surprisingly low peak exit velos. He played for Great Britain in the WBC, then caught 78 games during the regular season, then competed with GB again in the European Baseball Championship, then went to the Fall League. It's possible this guy was gassed. Ford is always going to have a huge hole in his swing — it's so big that his in-zone and overall contact rates aren't all that far apart.

His athleticism (he was a two-way college player), simple delivery, and easy arm action gave teams confidence in his ability to start despite a smallish frame and inconsistent command at that time. 
Meyer passed his first professional tests with flying colors, finishing the 2021 season with a 2.41 ERA at Double-A Pensacola. His fastball velocity was down, ""only"" in the 94-97 mph range. He began 2022 at Triple-A and pitched well (28.4% K%, 8.3% BB%, 50% GB%, 3.47 FIP, fastball again in the 94-97 range) before Meyer hit the IL for a month with ulnar nerve irritation. It was a harbinger of things to come, as Meyer returned and looked normal for another month, made his big league debut, and then was suddenly shut down. He had Tommy John in August of 2022 and missed all of 2023. We're inching closer to Meyer's return, emphasis on ""inching,"" as Marlins minor league pitching coordinator Scott Aldred told <em>Baseball America</em> recently that Meyer's return date is ""unknown,"" and that the team has only seen him throw on video. Meyer's changeup was quickly improving before he blew out despite his longer arm action. It and his amazing 90-92 mph slider should give him to bat-missing weapons as he gets further away from surgery. His fastball was not missing bats at Triple-A prior to his surgery, even as it averaged 95 mph, and unless it has more hop when he returns, Meyer's ceiling is probably capped in the mid-rotation area.","k7_4XDiW_aE","27474"

He notched over 123 innings of work without an IL stint, which was a welcome development considering scouts had some injury concerns surrounding college Cavalli, whose arm action is quite long and whose delivery is pretty violent. Cavalli spent 2022 at Rochester, where he wasn't as dominant as in 2021 but still pitched well, amassing a 3.25 FIP in just shy of 100 innings. He made his big league debut at the end of August, after which Cavalli was shut down with shoulder inflammation. While shoulder problems can derail a pitcher's career, Cavalli looked fine during his first couple of 2023 spring training outings, again sitting 96-97 mph with the same powerful mid-80s curveball he began to emphasize more in 2022. He seemed poised to seize an Opening Day rotation spot but Cavalli blew out his UCL in his third spring outing and needed Tommy John, which shelved him for all of 2023. The rate of TJ recovery is encouraging, so Cavalli's evaluation/valuation is unchanged — he still projects as a mid-rotation starter who is set to return sometime in 2024, having begun to throw bullpens sessions in spring training. 
Cavalli's fastball plays below its velocity, but his curveball is vicious and has ridiculous depth for how hard it is. His changeup also shows bat-missing ability and when it's combined with the vertical curveball, it gives Cavalli two weapons with which to attack lefties. Pitchers who are built like this and are this powerful and athletic tend to pan out over time, even when they have suboptimal fastball shape, with Sandy Alcantara representing the best recent example. Cavalli's changeup and slider quality aren't quite to that level, but at one point, neither were Sandy's. It's common for pitchers with arm actions as long as Cavalli's to re-map their arm path during rehab, so let's be on the lookout for that when he returns this year.",,"27473"

His overall offensive numbers sagged slightly as a Trash Panda, but certainly not in an alarming way, and his walk and strikeout rates both moved in a favorable direction. He was dealt to the White Sox as part of the Lucas Giolito trade and spent the rest of 2023 at Double-A Birmingham, where he maintained a performance slightly better than league average despite being significantly younger than the average Double-A player. He’s impressively mature at the plate, rarely expanding the zone and boasting the third-lowest swinging strike rate in all of Double-A in 2023. It’s particularly difficult to sneak one by Quero as a righty; he’s more contact-oriented from that side of the plate and has a bit more power as a lefty. Quero's swing is short and flat, which helps him make plus rates of contact. 
While his bat is the most promising part of his overall profile, he’s made improvements on defense in the past year that sweeten the pot significantly. His receiving is cleaner, and he’s shown improvements in his lateral movement and blocking. And while many of Quero's throws still one-hop second base, he has at least quickened his release enough to keep his pop times just below two seconds. Quero has rare bat-to-ball ability for a catcher and we think it will help him be Chicago's primary backstop eventually. He doesn't have to be put on the 40-man until after 2025, and it will probably be another season or two before we see him in the majors.","dLJiH3AmELA","sa3015239"

He has lovely all-fields ability to hit, snatching hanging breaking balls and inner-third fastballs to his pull side and spraying lots of middle-away fastballs to the opposite field. He's not quite as deft a hitter from the right side, but he's still plenty dangerous. Rocchio has not developed power as hoped even as he's filled out. He has shown progress in the plate discipline department and posted a career-high 11% walk rate in 2023, his second consecutive year with improvement in this area. Rocchio's body has gotten thick enough that he's more reliant on skills and actions now at shortstop than range and athleticism, but he still does enough to remain viable there. None of Cleveland's many interesting middle infield prospects of the last few years has emerged as a Dude, but Rocchio does enough to be considered a solid everyday shortstop and is probably the on-roster favorite to break camp with the job after a 23-game big league debut last season.","8RU-rUDZ2zw","23690"

He was a bat-first prospect on draft day whose defensive issues (ball blocking, throwing accuracy, a general lack of polish as a receiver) might have simply been due to a lack of playing time. Indeed, Rushing has begun to solve those issues while he's continued to have offensive success in pro ball. At High-A Great Lakes in his first full pro season, Rushing clubbed 15 homers, posted an 18.9% walk rate and slashed .228/.404/.452. 
Rushing hasn't suddenly become an elite receiver or pitch framer, but he's progressed enough to comfortably project as a catcher. His ball blocking still needs to improve quite a bit, as too often he tries to pick balls in the dirt with his hands rather than move his body to block them properly, and he isn't skilled enough to do it that way right now. Rushing's throwing arm has gotten much better, however. By the end of 2023, he was popping sub-1.9 seconds to second base thanks largely to the quickness of his exchange, and his throws were remarkably accurate. It's not a Gold Glove skill set, but it's enough for Rushing to more comfortably project as a catcher. 
Rushing's offense is similarly flawed but is viable for a catcher. His plate discipline is a meaningfully good skill that should enable him to run OBPs well above the average at his position. His swing is somewhat grooved (he struggles to cover stuff riding up and away from him, as well as back foot breakers), but it's geared for consistent pull-side lift and Rushing is going to hit for power when he does make contact. Rushing will likely be one of those primary catchers who hits .210 or so and still performs like an average starter because of his power and on-base skills.

He has had a plus sweeping breaking ball in his repertoire for some time now, and the movement of that pitch is mirrored by the nasty rise and tail action on his fastball. Watching Iriarte pitch is like watching Slender Man throw 97; he is extremely loose and has premium arm speed. He already features a huge stride down the mound and big hip/shoulder separation, and he still clearly has room for muscle on his frame. His low-90s changeup flashes huge tail, so much that Iriarte often struggles to command it, but his arm speed makes me want to project on this pitch in a big way. Iriarte is rather skinny and only showed premium velocity for roughly half of 2023. There's risk he doesn't maintain this velo bump, but because he's still projectable, there's also a possibility it will continue to trend up. 
Iriatre was a must-add 40-man guy during the offseason, and he has huge long-term ceiling. In most situations, a pitcher like him would be poised to spend his entire first year on the 40-man continuing to develop in the minors, but because the Padres are still so in need of pitching at this stage of the offseason, it's plausible Iriarte will be called upon to pitch in their rotation at some point in 2024.",,"sa3010798"

Once a somewhat undersized high school draftee with an inconsistent feel for strike-throwing, Jones has grown into a much more steady hand on the mound. His fastball sits 94-98 mph, with occasional triple digits sprinkled in, and he has a knack for missing bats with it. He started the season at Double-A, where the heater played well at the top of the zone for in-zone whiffs. When he was promoted to Triple-A, he let it creep up over the zone where it continued to miss bats, and his chase rate on the four-seamer nearly doubled, finishing his time at Indianapolis with a 40% chase rate on the offering. While his strike throwing improved upon his promotion, his home run rate increased at Triple-A, perhaps as a side effect of his aggressiveness in attacking the upper part of the zone with his four-seamer. His secondary of choice is his upper-80s slider, which he uses for in-zone strikes thanks to its downward movement. He also throws a low-80s curveball with more exaggerated downward tumble, and he'll challenge lefties with his improving changeup. The curve and the changeup aren't yet as developed as his slider, but they are promising, up-and-coming weapons to further fill out his arsenal as complements to his plus fastball and slider.

He was drafted as a long-term project with a big frame (6-foot-3, 205 pounds), present arm strength, and a loose, efficient arm action that portended secondary pitch development. Smith-Shawver began to throw harder pretty quickly after he got to pro ball, with his riding fastball parked in the 93-96 mph range for entire starts in 2023 and peaking above. The Braves augmented his release point a little bit, and it has created more lateral action on his formerly velo-reliant slider than that pitch had in 2022. They also added a mid-70s rainbow curveball that has a shape that complements his fastball; it often has a little arm-side action on it that should help make it a weapon against lefties as Smith-Shawver gets feel for it. 
Smith-Shawver rapidly ascended through High- and Double-A at the beginning of 2023, spent most of the year at Triple-A Gwinnett, and got a five-start cup of coffee in Atlanta before making the Braves' playoff roster as a reliever. His surface stats leave a little bit to be desired — he walked 15% of hitters at Gwinnett, and his strikeout rate plummeted once he was in the big leagues — but let's consider the context here. Smith-Shawver made the bigs less than two years after being drafted as a two-sport high school athlete. He did so while undergoing meaningful mechanical and repertoire tweaks, and he has the build, athleticism and mechanical attributes of a workhorse mid-rotation starter. He needs to find a more consistent release point to avoid a move to the bullpen, but it's appropriate to project on this because many of AJ's component parts are so new and malleable. Currently projected to be Atlanta's sixth starter when camp breaks, Smith-Shawver is forecast here as an eventual mid-rotation stalwart and will be a superior option to Bryce Elder at the back of Atlanta's rotation as soon as he can corral his feel for locating.",,"29960"

Instead he signed for $3 million as the first pick in the 2021 third round and was developed as a two-way player for parts of two seasons before focusing on pitching in 2023. Things went well. Chandler made 25 starts, worked 111 innings (a 60-inning increase from the season before), and after all that, his fastball was still humming in at 95-96 mph in a dominant, one-hit season-capping outing for Double-A Altoona. 
Chandler has now held mid-90s velocity across something close to a big league starter's innings tote, and he flashes plus, velo-driven secondary stuff. Chandler's slider and changeup both tend to live in the 85-88 mph range and are nastiest when they move late, though neither has a ton of quantifiable movement. Huge arm speed, a prototypical pitcher's frame, and Chandler's relative newness to pitching are all fantastic reasons to project on his secondary stuff, especially Chandler's changeup. There's relief risk here because Chandler's delivery is pretty violent, and even though his walk rate got better in 2023 (10.9%), he's historically been worse than that. 
If you want to choose your own scouting adventure here and take a data-driven approach to projecting Chandler, you might be inclined to regress his strike-throwing to his career mean and value him just below the 50 FV tier with the likes of Nick Nastrini and other probable relievers. An approach that cares a lot about the context of Chandler's development (as we've taken here) sees his 2023 as a sign of real progress.

His contact rate isn't great, though; in fact, it's at the very bottom of what there's precedent for among corner sluggers in the majors. He sometimes has trouble timing his long levers, especially against breaking balls below the strike zone and fastballs at the top of it. His eye for the strike zone is worse with two strikes against him, resulting in a consistently high strikeout rate that he has yet to tamp down and that is likely to be a continued area of focus for the young outfielder.

He was signed out of the Dominican Republic in 2018 and immediately started turning heads when he posted a 150 wRC+ as a 17-year-old in rookie ball, and while he’s hit stumbling blocks along the way, his power has never really been an issue. More questionable was whether or not he’d perform despite a free-wheeling, slider-chasing approach that resulted in enough swing-and-miss to dampen his  slugging capability until 2022, when he started getting to his power at a new level. In 2023, he seemed to turn another corner, lowering his strikeout and swinging strike rates while working deeper counts against opposing pitchers. Not only did he reach significantly more full counts in 2023 (129) than he had in 2022 (86), but his performance in those counts improved, with his OPS skyrocketing from .610 to 1.061 on 3-2 offerings. His promotion to Triple-A came with a noticeable uptick in swinging strikes and strikeouts, but that type of hiccup is common as minor leaguers move up the ladder. Plus, Orelvis has now made relevant adjustments a couple of times. Even with the uptick in strikeouts, his slash line improved in every column at Buffalo, and he finished the season with a 105 wRC+ despite being several years younger than the average Triple-A player. Orelvis typically leaves the building to his pull-side, yanking hanging breaking balls out past the left field foul pole.
His bat is good enough to quiet the qualms about his best defensive fit. Orelvis has mostly played shortstop, but his time trended more toward third base and then finally second base, which he began to learn after his promotion to Buffalo. He’s not particularly rangy or skilled at any one spot. Martinez has good max-effort arm strength, but he throws from a weird, slingy, awkward-looking armslot. Second base seems the most comfortable fit for him overall, but even if he’s a defensive nomad, his power, along with the improvements he’s made at the plate in order to get to it more consistently, is enough to warrant finding room for him in a big league lineup.","yHLBXVb004Y","sa3010692"

He went to school and raked, slashing .339/.411/.607 while building experience at a variety of positions (2B, SS, 3B, LF) before transitioning to third base full-time during his draft year. He was one of the handful of 50 FV or better prospects from a loaded 2023 draft, and fell deeper (12th overall) than players of his caliber tend to because of the class' depth up top. Troy spent about a month at High-A Hillsboro after signing and hit .247/.343/.447 with nine extra-base hits in 23 games (that's a 56 XBH pace across 145 games), but also struck out much more (26% K%) than was usual for him in college (14-19% his last two seasons). 
The Diamondbacks deployed Troy at shortstop but he didn't look great there. He's very tightly wound, much more an explosive athlete than an elegant and fluid one, and he can't put his body in position to make all the throws a shortstop has to make. Troy looked like he was getting very comfortable at third base toward the end of the 2023 college season. He plays lower to the ground when his hips get to be square than when he has to flip them to range laterally as a middle infielder, and his throws are more crisp and accurate from third than shortstop. It might be worth it to give Troy some reps in center field. He's a flat out 80-grade runner and, in our estimation, has a better shot of developing into a good center fielder than he does of becoming a passable shortstop. 
Offensively, you can get Troy out by executing breaking stuff away from him, which he either rolls over or swings inside of entirely. He otherwise has really excellent plate coverage and packs surprising punch for a hitter his size, which has been a feature of his profile since high school. His scissor-kick-style swing is geared for banging high fastballs into the opposite field gap. Troy's ceiling is highest if he can play an up-the-middle position, but his most direct path to the bigs is probably via exclusivity at third base. He's projected here as an everyday third baseman, perhaps transitioning from a superutility debut into being the everyday guy at the hot corner when Eugenio Suárez's contract is up.",,"sa3022561"

Melendez. Some of the underlying hit tool issues that Cartaya performed in spite of during previous seasons became untenable in 2023, as upper-level opposing pitchers executed to the locations he struggles to cover, which are copious. This is nothing new — Cartaya has had elevated strikeout rates in the lower minors (26% or more) since 2021, and hit tool risk has been a part of his profile the entire time. It will continue to be, but if Cartaya can get to enough of his power and continue to develop on defense (more on that in a second), then he's still likely to clear the low offensive bar at catcher. The physical punishment inherent in catchers' duties can have a pretty serious impact on how they perform on offense for long stretches of time. Cartaya's bat looked unusually slow in 2023 and his max exit velocity declined three ticks from the previous season; his issues were not as simple as him having a low BABIP (although he did at .216). The exit velo decline could point to some underlying malady, or at least is an indication that Cartaya wasn't in peak physical form last year. He had multiple injury issues in prior seasons (mostly back and hamstring). At age 22, it's fair to conclude that he's not in physical decline, and that whatever his 2023 issue, it might be remedied or healed with an offseason of rest. If anything, broad-shouldered, 22-year-old hitters who are built like castle drawbridges, as Cartaya is, tend to merit more projection into their mid-20s. 
Cartaya still has developing to do on defense, but he's a pretty good bet to remain a catcher. His receiving and ball-blocking are still below average (common for a 22-year-old, but it's frustrating that Cartaya has been treading water in this regard), and too often he fumbles the baseball during his exchange, but his raw arm strength is very good and he has the big, durable frame typical of a primary catcher. 
He is no longer on the expressway to Chavez Ravine like it seemed he was a year ago, but Cartaya is still a high-ceiling catching prospect who stands a chance to be an impact regular. One of Cartaya's option years has now passed. Will Smith is entrenched ahead of him, and fellow catching prospects Dalton Rushing and Thayron Liranzo put themselves in the medium-term 40-man mix with great 2023 seasons. It's very important for Cartaya to rebound in 2024 so he can enter his final option year as a viable big league option. You could point to any of the Dodgers' good catching prospects as candidates for trade, and Smith's presence increases the likelihood that any of them begins their career as a backup, which is especially true for Cartaya because he's already on the 40-man roster. We're not totally ignoring Cartaya's 2023 flop, but our instincts here are to avoid overcorrection and continue to project Cartaya as a long-term primary catcher.","c-LTwTIlv7s","sa3008742"

Even as he hit .286/.406/.504 at Low-A and .280/.371/.494 at High-A across his first 126 full-season games, all as a young-for-the-level hitter, Mayer has had pretty gnarly splits against offspeed and breaking pitches for the past two seasons. His offensive performance collapsed when he was promoted to Double-A Portland and he was shut down in early August with a left shoulder impingement and inflammation. Synergy Sports has Mayer slashing .154/.221/.269 against secondary pitches in 2023, but with a .795 OPS versus fastballs. While Marcelo's hands are explosive and powerful, his front side is so upright and stiff through contact that it makes it tough for him to cover the bottom of the strike zone. He swings over the top of a ton of softer stuff in the strike zone. There are players who have remedied similar issues in recent years — such as Max Muncy and seemingly Spencer Torkelson — and the ceiling on Marcelo's power output is huge if he can do so too. 
Compounding things was a regression in his defense. Mayer was a bit boxier than the usual elite shortstop prospect, but his hands and actions were so skillful and polished that he seemed likely to play there despite middling range. Perhaps because his mobility was compromised from the general discomfort of a shoulder issue, Mayer's range backed up in 2023. His footwork and actions are still very polished, but his range and arm were on the fringe. He may be able to play short if just one of those traits is an issue, but probably not both. Again, there are recent examples of players who have undergone a rapid physical transformation while still a prospect (be it Bo Bichette and Julio Rodríguez in a helpful way, Kevin Maitan in a seemingly detrimental way), and it feels like Mayer is perhaps at a fork in the road of this kind. Lefty-hitting shortstops with plus power are rare, and we want to signal some alarm here while still holding Mayer's grade in a place that values his upside in the event that this stuff gets resolved. Because of the missing 2020 summer, we aren't long from Mayer having been frustrating for a longer than he was good, and whether or not he looks much better out of the gate in Fort Myers is an important thing to monitor. We will probably have a quick hook here here if things don't look good.",,"sa3017114"

This is a power-hitting shortstop prospect with a below-average hit tool. Arias swings with bad intentions. He has premium bat speed and is looking to do big damage with each healthy hack. He is also a skilled and acrobatic shortstop defender with fantastic actions and arm strength. Those tools in concert with one another give Arias a good shot to be an impact player even though his style of hitting will likely limit his rate of contact. Arias has a classic low-ball lefty swing (he only had 12 PA as a right-handed batter in 2023) and is vulnerable to rise-and-run heaters in the top half of the zone. Because of his injuries, he's had very few actual in-game reps to make adjustments in this regard, and it's plausible his hit tool will polish with time and experience.

He was on the short list of players who entered 2023 with a chance to ""Chourio,"" i.e. leap into the top 10 overall prospect mix within the next year. Instead, Bleis had a bad first month of full-season ball, subluxated his left shoulder during a swing at the end of May, and ended up needing season-ending surgery. 
Bleis has all-world bat speed and rare rotational athleticism. His timing at the plate and breaking ball recognition were pretty bad during his brief 2023 sample, and he often looked uncomfortable and erratic at the plate before he was shut down. Bleis' best swings produce shocking raw power for such a lithe young hitter, and he might grow into more. In part because of Roman Anthony's presence, Bleis played a mix of center and right field before his injury. He has the speed and range to play center, but is procedurally raw when it comes to things like communicating with the other outfielders and where he decides to throw the baseball. Projected viability in center is a big part of why Bleis is graded this high despite the volatility with his offense, which was already significant and became greater because of the missed reps last year. Would he have made an in-season adjustment had he stayed healthy? Or would he have endured an entire season of struggles and fallen away from this tier of player more starkly? If Bleis fails to make adjustments, then he's on more of a Jose Siri trajectory. His talent is big enough that it should eventually shine through despite his approach.",,"sa3016834"

When he can actually get a throw to the bag off, his Patrick Bailey-style sidearm release works ok, but he so often botches or fumbles his exchange that he doesn't give himself a chance to get the runner. Liranzo mostly utilizes a traditional crouch when receiving and is a below-average framer and ball-blocker. Both those skills are more tenable and within the range of big league viability than his arm, but at Liranzo's size and age, it's no guarantee they'll stay that way. 
There is huge switch-hitting power here — Liranzo hit 24 bombs in the Cal League, hit a ball 114 mph, and had a 48% hard-hit rate last year. He can hit for power from the left side even when he isn't taking his best swing, and he's dangerous from the right side even though he uses super conservative footwork, generating everything with a shift in his weight and the strength of his hands. Liranzo doesn't have great feel for the barrel, which is typical for a young a switch-hitter, let alone one of atypical size. His 65% contact rate is below the threshold of any 2023 big league first baseman (Bryce Harper's was at 68%, the next lowest was 72%), so there's substantial Quad-A risk here if Liranzo can't catch. Whether or not he stays back there is the difference between Cal Raleigh and M.J. Melendez from a production standpoint. Arm strength is perhaps a little less teachable than other issues young catchers often need to fix, which is worrisome in this case. He has a little more minor league experience than some of the other prospects who present a combination of extreme ceiling and risk, and Liranzo's high-end outcomes are driving his placement here.",,"sa3015790"

Pitchers with changeups as good as Thorpe’s and who throw as many strikes as he does tend to be high-floor propositions who pitch forever. His low-80s changeup, which he locates at will, has a ton of tail, and his ultra-short arm stroke helps trick hitters into seeing fastball out of his hand. The effectiveness of Thorpe’s slider (more average in terms of raw stuff) and fastball (below-average at just 90–92 mph) is enabled by his precise feel for location. He can sink his fastball down and to his arm side, or run a four-seam version of it past hitters at the letters. The Yankees coaxed a little more heat out of Thorpe (who sat 88–91 in college) during his time in their org, but not enough to give him impact velocity. He will throw the occasional cutter or curveball in an obvious fastball count to keep hitters guessing, but those pitches don't currently have any more utility than that, though I think the cutter eventually will. This is a very polished 23-year-old who, given San Diego’s tendency to push prospects quickly, is likely to grab hold of a big league rotation spot in the upcoming season.

The quick ascent came to an abrupt halt in July, though, when the lefty was shut down for the rest of the season with an elbow sprain. As such, his writeup is largely the same now as it was then, with Whisenhunt’s changeup standing out as his obvious signature pitch, garnering obscene swing-and-miss and fueling an overall swinging strike rate of 19% across the three levels he played at in 2023. In his six starts at Double-A, hitters started showing a bit more patience, laying off the out-of-zone changeups that less advanced hitters had offered at, resulting in his walk rate ballooning 13.1% by the time he was shut down for the season. 
Since he only played a handful of games after our last report, the top of his to-do list remains the same: namely, upon his return, he'll be tasked with continuing to hone his command of his arsenal and bolster his fastball’s playability, with the aim being to miss more bats with the heater at the top of the zone in order to take some pressure off his stellar changeup. He should be back on the mound for spring training and could conceivably find his way back onto the fast track he was on before his injury last season.",,"sa3020529"

Throughout 2022 and 2023, he sat 94-97 with riding life and would frequently top out in the 98-99 range. Dollander's hard cutter/slider looks more like the latter the deeper into games he pitches. As that pitch slows down from the 87-89 mph range to the 84-86 mph band throughout a start, it tends to add length and have more typical slider shape. An upper-70s curveball and mid-80s changeup sit in the back seat together; each had less than 10% usage in 2022 and combined for just 14% usage in 2023. Those pitches are going to have to be leaned on more in pro ball — Dollander's fastball is good, but not so good that he'll be able to deploy it 65% of the time (his 2023 mark) against big leaguers. Dollander's arm speed portends changeup growth, but the ones he throws now tend to sail on him. His curveball has distinct shape from his slider and has fine depth for an upper-70s curve, Dollander just doesn't consistently land his location with this pitch either. He barely walked anyone as a sophomore even though he was throwing harder and threw 30 more innings than the season before, but then wasn't as dominant as a junior. His BB/9 doubled and he became much more hittable, his WHIP ""ballooning"" from .797 to 1.24, which is still good but not top-of-the-draft good. He was drafted by the Rockies ninth overall and did not pitch after he signed. He's very similar to the high-variance developmental arms on a typical Top 100 list.",,"sa3023361"

His curveball looked like it had gotten better during his draft spring, then his elbow blew out and he needed Tommy John, which precipitated his fall in the draft. Lesko was already the consensus top high school pitcher in the draft before the curveball showed up and would have been a lock for the top 10 had he stayed healthy throughout the spring, but instead he fell to no. 15, where he was picked by San Diego. Lesko looked incredible when he first returned to the mound in 2023, sitting comfortably in the mid-90s with explosive vertical movement across an inning or two of complex duty in Peoria. He ended up pitching 33 innings, ending the year with a few walk-prone starts at High-A Fort Wayne. 
This is a downward adjustment to Lesko's 2023 in-season FV grade because of issues that cropped up as he got further underway coming off of Tommy John. His command and mechanical consistency and ease wavered when he was asked to throw more than two innings. This might be remedied simply through reps, as Lesko matures and gets further away from TJ. What might not be so easy to solve is that Lesko might have The Lucas Giolito Curveball Problem, which is to say that while Lesko's fastball tends to have downhill trajectory, his huge, mid-70s curveball does not. It pops out up out of his hand on release and, at 20 mph slower than his fastball, is easy to identify. It was only chased at a 15% rate in 2023, per Synergy Sports; the big league chase rate on any given pitch was 29% in 2023. It's a sexy-looking 73-77 mph curveball with big depth, and it will have strike-getting utility, but that may be it. Lesko's changeup is also pretty slow, sitting 79-82 mph, approximately 15 mph slower than his fastball. It has ridiculous screwball action and Lesko makes frequent, non-traditional use of it as an in-zone weapon. 
There's still huge upside here. Lesko might eventually parlay his feel for spin into a good cutter or slider, or develop impact command (he's barely pitched, after all), but all of those things are distant enough right now to dial down where he lines up on the Top 100.",,"sa3020677"

He put up similarly staggering strikeout numbers in the DSL, his fastball sitting comfortably in the high 90s and occasionally hitting triple digits, with an uphill angle despite Morales’ lanky frame and long arm action. His strikeout numbers took a significant tumble when he joined the A’s Low-A squad and have settled into the mid-20s ever since, likely indicating how few guys in the DSL are as fearsome as he is.

His 6-foot-5 frame is lanky and projectable, and his arm works loose and free and routinely generates mid-90s velocity, peaking at 99-100. 
Meyer will also show you a devastating two-plane breaking ball featuring both huge depth and lateral action. At times it's easy to identify out of his hand because it's so much slower than his fastballs, sometimes 20 mph slower than the pitch before. His pro breaking balls were a little bit harder, sometimes as hard as 85 mph. The change in velocity is perhaps an indication that the Marlins are trying to tweak Meyer's breaking ball, but the talent to have an impact sweeper is clearly present. The same is true of Meyer's changeup, which he didn't often have cause to throw in high school games, but it might end up being his best pitch. Meyer's slot helps impart a lot of lateral action on his changeup, which has huge tailing action in the mid-90s. His arm swing is really long and yet he has pretty good feel for locating all of his offerings. 
Meyer is an open strider from the first base side of the rubber. Most of his fastballs start on the glove-side corner of the plate before tailing up and to the arm side, while his slider works in the opposite direction, starting on the corner and bending away. The low release height relative to Meyer's shooting guard frame will entice data-driven decision-makers because of his shallow approach angle (his slot actually looked a little higher at NHSI than during the 2022 summer) and potential to miss bats at the top of the zone.

We'd like to see him continue to get physically stronger for the purposes of durability, an area where we think Hence plateaued in 2023. He's a fantastic on-mound athlete, but he's on the smaller side and added strength might help him have the stamina to finish his pitches more consistently.

His 2023 stats were eye-popping, with a .418/.484/.673 slash line that helped earn him the 14th overall selection in last year's draft. Teel climbed through Boston’s minor league system after being drafted, spending time on the complex and at High-A before wrapping up the season at Double-A; he finished the year with a 173 wRC+ across those three levels. That’s especially impressive given that he had already played a full season of college baseball before that, and as a catcher no less. 
His swing is not particularly aesthetically pleasing, with enough violence to knock his helmet clean off with virtually every hack, but given the results it has yielded, it seems to be working well enough for him not to mess with it too much at this point, especially given how quick his hands are and how well he’s able to get his barrel on balls throughout the zone. While Teel’s chase rate crept up over the course of his college career (it was an uncomfortably high 28% his junior year), his early days as a professional haven’t been as plagued by chase as that would imply, though the sample is of course rather small. 
Teel’s defensive movements are also rather mechanically maniacal, with a ton of extraneous movement as the pitcher completes his windup. Unlike the ain't-broke-don't-fix-it approach to his offensive mechanics, his defense may need to be simplified as he’s tasked with receiving more advanced arsenals as he progresses. Teel’s arm is strong, but as with the rest of his movements, it’s an atypical look for a catcher, as he slings the ball from a sidearm slot that at times looks more like an off-balance cross-diamond throw from a shortstop. Odd duck as he may be across the board, Teel nevertheless presents a well-rounded overall profile and seems likely to stick at catcher.",,"sa3022886"

Emerson was mistake-prone on defense after he signed, as the pace of the game was a little much for him on that side of the ball. His hands are alive with quickness and strength when he hits, though. Emerson has a very pleasing, compact swing geared for contact toward the bottom of the zone. He made above-average rates of contact in a small big league sample but we expect that Emerson's Ks will probably climb because of his swing, and he bears some mechanical similarities to a lefty-hitting Keston Hiura. What was maybe more surprising about Emerson's pro output was his power. Our pre-draft eval thought Emerson's smaller frame capped his power production, but on a pro field he already looks like he has early average raw pop.

He was shut down after the 2022 draft and debuted during 2023 big league spring training with much more velocity than he had previously shown, which he proceeded to maintain across 106.2 innings this season. Hampton blew away Sally League hitters (40.5% K%) in the first half of the year before he seemed to lose his legs a little bit in a second half spent at Double-A Somerset. His line to the plate became less consistent, the timing of his fairly long arm stroke wavered, and he had some walk-prone starts in the mid-to-late summer. It's still pretty amazing that Hampton was able to sit 93-96 for much of the season (more 92-95 late) as he basically doubled his previous career innings high. 
Hampton's arm action is pretty reliever-y and long, but because of the way his fastball plays, he doesn't have to have pinpoint command in order to remain a starter. His well-located fastballs work uphill with plus riding life, and Hampton is competent enough at peppering the top half of the zone with the pitch to project as a starter. The heater is one of a troika of offerings Hampton has to miss bats, along with a 12-to-6 hammer curveball and a mid-80s two-plane slider. He'll be able to get ahead of hitters the second and third time through the order with his curveball and cutter, and then finish guys with high fastballs. 
I suppose there's still some amount of risk here, as Hampton has only really thrown consistent strikes for two months of his collegiate and minor league career. It's possible he ends up on a trajectory like Clarke Schmidt's, where it takes him a while to establish himself as a part of the rotation, but I think the way Hampton's fastball plays will mask some of his imprecision.

Scott is rail thin and not especially strong, but he makes an above-average rate of contact and does have other soft skills like baserunning and bunting that act as the cherry on top of a catalytic offensive player. Scott reached safely on 17 bunts last year, which is reminiscent of TJ Friedl, who had a lot of success in 2023 as a very similar player.

Busch's strikeout rate dipped below 19% at the highest minor league level and his walk rate climbed to almost 14%, with chase and swinging strike rates considerably better than league average, illustrating a refined approach at the plate. His performance at the major league level was somewhat atypical for him. His groundball rate spiked but it’s too small a sample to be alarming at this point. Jed Hoyer has hinted at first base being his likely defensive home as a Cub. We still think Busch is an excellent, well-rounded hitter who can be a top 15-20 player at that position even though we liked it better when he stood a chance of being an Uggla-esque defender at the keystone. Busch's well-rounded offensive skill set and track record at the plate are enough to make up for his lack of defensive utility, and he's much more likely to be the long-term answer at first base in Chicago than anyone else currently on their 40-man roster.","2A597xbLtFA","26319"

It has the feel of a Tim Duncan-era Spurs draft pick, an absolute coup for a contender that tends to get the most out of their own prospects and could use, at worst, another late-inning weapon in the near future. 
The Braves pushed Waldrep so quickly after the draft that for a minute it looked like he'd be elevated to their postseason roster in a relief role. If the org chooses to put him on a more direct route to the majors, Waldrep certainly has the stuff to thrive in a high-leverage relief capacity, headlined by his vicious, screwball-style upper-80s changeup. It's a devastating, airbender-esque pitch that plays against lefties and righties alike. Waldrep's approach to pitching is such that he likely won't work efficiently as a starter. His fastball is surprisingly hittable considering its velocity and Waldrep's vertical arm angle, which should theoretically be helping him create bat-missing, riding life on his heater. He often has to work above the zone with his fastball for it to be effective, and Waldrep runs deep counts because of this. The ability to competently land a breaking ball for a strike contributes to his starter projection here. Waldrep has an upper-80s cutter/slider (or maybe he throws each of those now?) and threw a slower curveball in college, but the curve wasn't so much a part of his attack after the draft (which is why we're wondering if he's added a cutter). Drey Jameson and Reese Olson present recent skill set comps to Waldrep, who has a no. 3 starter's ceiling and an impact reliever's floor.",,"sa3022942"

Just before the COVID shutdown, Hurt shoved against TCU (6 IP, 9 K, 1 BB, 1 R) at a heavily attended tournament in LA, touching 95 mph several times. It was the best he ever looked at Southern Cal and he might have dramatically improved his draft stock had he pitched the whole spring. The Marlins drafted him, then later traded him and Alex Vesia to the Dodgers for Dylan Floro. Hurt spent most of 2021 on the shelf and only pitched about 20 innings during the regular season before he looked nasty — 94-97 mph with natural cut and a plus changeup — in the Arizona Fall League. 
Over the last two seasons, Hurt has built his innings count to 100 frames while retaining the velo spike, his tailing changeup has continued to improve to the point where it's now one of the best in the minors, and he's improved his ability to land both of his breaking balls for strikes. Hurt's 19.7% swinging strike rate was the highest in the 2023 minor leagues among pitchers who threw at least 80 innings. He's a heavier guy with a high-effort delivery, definitely a look you see in the bullpen more often than in the rotation, and Hurt's fastball command is not good. There's a lot of relief risk here, but we're buying that the combo of Hurt's feel for spotting his breakers and his changeup's ability to bail him out of any count will allow him to start. Hurt has only tended to work between 3-5 innings at a time. He's an inefficient operator and will probably be a five-and-dive type of starter with elevated peripherals. He's on the 40-man roster and got a two-inning cup of coffee in the majors last September. He might be on an innings count that pushes him into the big league bullpen toward the end of his rookie year.",,"27514"

After that IL stint, Salinas returned to Double-A Midland and closed the season out with similar numbers to what he had put up before the injury. His performance at the Fall League was exciting to watch, as he showed off an arsenal featuring a riding mid-90s four-seamer, a sinker, two distinct plus breaking balls, and a serviceable changeup. It's an impressively robust mix, especially for a 22-year-old. He's got a bit of a bowling ball physique, but that doesn't mean he’s unathletic, with smooth, loose pitching mechanics and a fearless approach to attacking hitters with his full arsenal, such that if any one pitch isn't working for him, he’s got a trusty bag of tricks to use as a workaround.",,"sa3009243"

He returned from the shoulder injury in late August and was sent to the Fall League, where Roby continued to show great stuff but wayward command. Some of his outings were dominant, while others were frustrating. At a stocky 6-foot-1, Roby's build is atypical for a workhorse starter, and his delivery is pretty violent. His best role might be in as a vicious long reliever, where he can comfortably air out his best fastballs and feel free to work a little inefficiently.

He began 2022, his first full pro season, on a tear before injuring his back in early May. House did not look the same after he returned. He struck out a third of the time and posted an OPS of just .602 before being shut down for the remainder of the season in mid-June. We thought it was safe to assume he was playing through injury and House was left on last offseason's Top 100 list under the assumption that he'd return healthy in 2023. He basically did, and while we still have some apprehension about aspects of his swing and his plate coverage, a fully actualized House has star-level ability, tools that give him rare enough ceiling to value him among the top 100 prospects even though he still has bust risk.
House rewarded our patience by pulverizing Low-A pitching, generating a 142 wRC+ in his first 36 games back with Fredericksburg and a 145 wRC+ in a couple of weeks at High-A Wilmington. He has plus raw power right now (48% hard-hit rate, 113 mph max exit velo) and should grow into more as he fills out. His contact and chase rates (68% and 36%, respectively) are suspect, and some of what we're seeing with House's swing does give us pause about him continuing to make sufficient levels of contact now that he's reached Double-A. He's got a very upright base when he swings and tends to step in the bucket, both of which leave House's plate coverage lacking. His poor breaking ball recognition compounds this, and he's going to have to do a better job of either closing his front side during his swing so he can contact sliders on the outer edge, or laying off them entirely. House definitely did a better job of pulling the ball in 2023 and he's still played so few pro games due to injury that we're bullish on his ability to make adjustments even though we're quite sure he's soon going to need to. 
The oppo power and chase combo here isn't all that different from same-aged Josh Jung. Perhaps most impressively, House's defense has been fantastic. Because he's so big, House (who was a high school shortstop) was sometimes projected to right field, as it's rare for athletes his size to stay on the infield. But his ability to bend and move at his size is incredible, he has plus hands, he can throw on the run, and his feeds to the other bases are accurate and timely. He not only looks like a sure bet to stay at third but is potentially an impact defender there, which is especially impressive considering he's not all that far removed from a season-altering back injury. There's still a ton of volatility here but the power upside is significant, and House's defense helps give him another slump-immune tool to keep his profile afloat if it turns out his hit tool is a long-term problem.","LgJWO0o1GtM","sa3017694"

The Mariners also made his swing better pretty quickly, though he still has a lot of extraneous movement in his hands. Farmelo can create big power in a short mechanical distance, he has pretty good bat control, and he should be able to iron out the clunkier aspects of his swing with pro instruction.

The Rangers international scouting group was originally connected to a player named Camilo Diaz for a rumored bonus of $3 million but seemingly diverted to Walcott around this time (Diaz signed with Houston). Walcott signed last January and spent a big chunk of spring training in Arizona, where he stood apart from his peers on the backfields because of his bat speed. He went to the D.R. for the start of the DSL season, but was quickly promoted to the Complex League and lit things up for a month before opponents realized he couldn't recognize a breaking ball. He ended up having a .273/.325/.524 line in Arizona with a terrifying 6.4% walk rate and 32.5% strikeout rate. 
Those are red flag peripherals on the complex, but at the time of Top 100 publication, Walcott will still be 17 for another month. He was playing a level or two above what's typical for a hitter that age (especially as DSL hitters repeat the level more often to avoid using a domestic minor league roster spot, it'd be typical for someone Walcott's age to do that in 2024) and has immense physical ability and long-term projection. He looks like a future NFL wide receiver in his uniform and has the kind of pull power you'd expect from a prospect built like that. This is a 6-foot-4 teenager with elite hand speed and power projection. Walcott's swing and feel to hit need a ton of polish, though. The timing of his footwork in the box isn't great and he ends up lunging at breakers, plus Walcott's swing is driven by his bottom hand in a path that slopes down unless he's making contact way out in front, and he often has no chance at hitting pitches on the outer edge. Couple that with a fuzzy defensive projection because of Walcott's size and error-prone early career look at short and there are teams that don't think he carries this much weight. But he already has nearly plus raw big league power at age 17 and could feasibly produce on offense like peak Javier Báez if Walcott's hit tool develops enough.",,"sa3021069"

He didn't have a ton of showcase experience, and while clearly a skilled hitter in the scant showcase PAs he did put on tape, he was a heavy-bodied first base prospect who'd need to mash to profile. Several teams drafting through around pick 60 or so were on Isaac, so the Rays weren't alone in liking him, and so far the pick looks great, as Isaac hit .285/.395/.521 with 19 homers at mostly Low-A Charleston in his first full season. 
Isaac has pretty dramatically remade his body and now looks more like Nate Lowe than coaching-era Sidney Lowe. He's slimmed down without losing strength (on the contrary, he has 60-grade big league power right now), and Isaac has rare fluidity in his hips for a hitter his size. There are flashes of rare power and feel for hitting here; if you put Isaac's balls in play on tape, he's adjusting to all kinds of different pitches in different locations and using his immense strength to move the baseball all over the field. 
Look under the statistical hood and things get more complicated. Isaac ran a sub-70% contact rate in 2023; only one qualified big league first baseman (Bryce Harper) did that in 2023. A couple of other successful role players (Luke Raley, Ryan Noda) were also in that range, but it's rare for a first baseman to run a contact rate this low and be successful. While Isaac's athleticism makes what he's doing in the batter's box look smooth and graceful, he probably has more going on with his swing than a young man of his prodigious strength needs to. He doesn't always track pitches well and he swings inside a lot of stuff on the outer third, especially changeups, which Isaac offers at early in part because his cut is so involved. The good news is we think Isaac will have such enormous power at maturity (he also has above-average plate discipline) that he'll offset his contact issues. We also think there's a chance his hit tool progresses beyond its current state because we're talking about a young hitter who hasn't played against elite competition very much.",,"sa3020498"

Having been a pitcher in high school, he is not being developed as a two-way player, and instead has thus far spent his time in right field, though his size and limited mobility may result in a move to first base, especially when his body fills out.

Some of it is supported by his data. Caba's 3% swinging strike rate and 90% contact rate in 2023 were both among the best in all of the minor leagues. The visual scouting report of Caba's hit tool was strong when he was an amateur, and now the data (insofar as DSL performance data can be useful) indicates he may have a superlative future as a contact hitter. On tape, you can see him manipulating the barrel with precocious skill for a teenage switch hitter, enough that I feel comfortable pushing his future hit tool projection a grade above where I had it when Caba was an amateur. 
I've buried the lede a bit here because what makes Caba very special is his defense. His footwork and actions are ridiculous, among the most deft and electric I've seen on a shortstop, reminiscent of José Iglesias. There are some overall similarities with a young Francisco Lindor in terms of Caba's build, glove, and switch-hitting, though Lindor had substantially more power at Caba's age. 
Frequent readers know I love to the use the draft as a lens through which to FV pro teenagers, and in Caba's case, I think you can argue he'd have gone as high as sixth in the 2023 draft (where Oakland took contact maven Jacob Wilson) and no lower than 22nd, where Seattle drafted hit-tool stalwart Colt Emerson (who probably should have gone much higher than that). I do worry about repeating my over-evaluation of Yankees shortstop Alexander Vargas here, but the possibility of two potentially elite carrying tools (and the early evidence we have that they'll manifest) has me excited enough to put Caba toward the back of the Top 100 list.",,"sa3021070"

He's a skilled, well-rounded player with an unusually high floor for a teenage prospect thanks to his defense and bat-to-ball ability, the latter of which is heightened by his excellent plate discipline. I wrote Rodriguez up as a more of a utility guy when he was an amateur because he lacks the big-frame body projection typical of a star player, but now that he's accumulated a DSL season's worth of data, both his plate skills and contact ability are profile-driving attributes. We're talking 86% contact, 93% in-zone contact, and only 19% chase. DSL metrics like this are only so meaningful, but put on Rodriguez's tape and he <em>looks</em> like a really good hitter. He tracks pitches with bird-of-prey precision and makes flush, high-quality contact with a lovely and effortless left-handed swing. 
Rodriguez is also a good shortstop defender. His exchange on slow rollers in on the grass is sometimes clunky, but otherwise he can make the requisite shortstop plays, his hands and range are plus, and I think something closer to prototypical arm strength will arrive with physical maturity. This is not a monster-ceiling'd DSL prospect — Rodriguez is more in the Brayan Rocchio-ish, high-probability bucket. Once again, using recent draft prospects as a way to triangulate more correct list placement for DSL guys would slot Rodriguez behind the Marcelo Mayer and Jordan Lawlars of the world, and closer to the Colt Emerson/Jett Williams tier of player who often belong in the 10-15 range of a draft board.",,"sa3021101"

Festa has had a pretty significant velo spike in pro ball and in 2023 reached Triple-A at the very end of a solid season mostly spent at Double-A Wichita. Since turning pro, the 6-foot-6 Festa's velocity has grown year-over-year until he he reached the 94-96 mph range his fastball has resided in for the last two seasons. His approach to pitching with his heater has changed and become less efficient as, due to a lack of explosive movement on the pitch, Festa has begun to take a slider-first approach. He often tries to get ahead of hitters with sliders that drop into the top of the strike zone, and when Festa is locating both his slider and changeup to opposite corners of the plate, each of them is capable of missing bats against hitters of either handedness. Both secondary pitches generated above-average rates of chase and miss in 2023. 
Festa has pitched about 100 innings each of the last two seasons without seeing a drop off in velocity. All of his offerings are pretty firm — even his slider and changeup are often 87-88 mph — and without a pitch that more drastically alters hitters' timing, he may end up generating more weak contact than outright whiffs against big league hitters. Even though Festa will be 24 this season, his rare combination of size and athleticism might portend another gear of arm strength and/or command as he continues to refine the feel for his endless limbs. He's projected here as an innings-eating no. 4 starter on a contender who might have peak years as an impact mid-rotation guy if either his command or velocity levels up one more time.

After starting the year on the IL with an oblique strain, Scott mowed through A-ball hitters and quickly reached Binghamton, where he spent most of the year. Across as career-high 19 starts and 87.2 innings, Scott struck out 107 hitters and walked just 12 while not only holding his usual velo, but increasing it to 94-95 mph on average. 
Scott has a huge wingspan and gets way down the mound, traits that combine to give him huge extension and a shallow approach angle. His fastball really jumps on hitters, and he missed a ton of bats with it at the top of the zone even though it's technically a sinker. He's always had a pretty juicy slider, but now Scott seems to have altered his changeup into a firmer split (its average velo has increased by about five ticks, often 84-88 mph), giving him a pretty complete mix. Some of what Scott is doing mechanically is pretty violent (he has a pretty nasty head whack), and you can see why he was 'penned in the past, but he's thrown a ton of strikes in pro ball (this is definitely a control over command guy) and has mostly proven he can sustain an impact fastball across a starter's load of innings. From a craftsmanship standpoint, Scott is close to being big league ready.

He moved into the Lions' rotation in 2021 and had a great season — 91 IP, 95 K, just 98 baserunners allowed — despite sitting mostly 90-91 mph. The Yankees shut him down for the post-draft period of 2021, and when play began in 2022, Warren had a new breaking ball and much more velocity, which he has sustained across the last two seasons at Somerset and Scranton. 
Even though he isn't on their 40-man roster, Warren is arguably in a better position to crack the Yankees' 2024 rotation than other pitchers who are. He has a better track record of strike-throwing and recent health than Luis Gil or Clayton Beeter. Warren checks every scouting box aside from the one in the ""pretty delivery"" column. His cross-bodied mechanics and head whack are more violent than is ideal, but Warren has now sustained good stuff across anywhere between 90 and 130 innings in each of the last three years, evidence he can succeed despite this delivery. His repertoire has grown to five useful pitches, with the best two being his heavy sinker, which has periods where it's parked in the 94-95 mph range, and his sweeper-style slider, which moves similarly to Blake Treinen's. These two pitches diverge horizontally in a way that gives hitters fits. Warren's sweeper garnered swinging strikes at an incredible 20% clip in 2023, and his sinker generated a 67% groundball rate. Warren also has a four-seam variant that he runs up the ladder as a chase pitch, and he has an upper-80s cutter that has become a more useful way to attack lefties than his middling changeup, which has a good bit of movement but is too similar to his sinker's shape and velocity to be very disruptive. There might be room for growth in the offspeed/changeup realm for Warren yet; some of his best cambios are the ones that cut on him and look more like splitters. A true splitter might give him a dynamic swing-and-miss weapon versus lefties, which he currently lacks. Otherwise, Warren does a little bit of everything. His pitch mix compares closely to Joe Musgrove's (his command isn't quite <em>that</em> great) and, similarly, Warren profiles as a big league ready, mid-rotation starter.",,"sa3018149"

He returned to the minors in August for a few rehab games at Low- and then Triple-A before making his way back to the bigs in September, where he was used largely in relief or as an opener and was on a strict pitch count. Sadly, the injury was nothing new for Miller, who has struggled to stay healthy throughout his professional career, likely due in large part to the violence in his delivery. Miller’s big time velocities are a huge contributor to what makes him so exciting to watch, and he reaches those speeds thanks to explosive, late arm speed. When his foot lands during his delivery, his throwing arm is still pointing downward, then erupts in a whirr of motion, which puts added stress on his joints by the time he releases the ball. So while that arm speed is perhaps necessary for him to be the force that he is, it’s also possibly the reason he should limit his time out there. At the Winter Meetings, GM David Forst indicated a move to the bullpen was likely in 2024, saying that Miller and Lucas Erceg were in the mix to compete for the closer role.

His stuff got even better under the tutelage of Cleveland’s player dev system, and he dominated during his 2021 full season debut, putting up a strikeout rate north of 40% while shortening his arm action and altering his slot to impart more vertical movement on his heater. Espino had taken another leap at the onset of 2022, sitting in the 98-102 mph range with a fastball that sometimes had 20-23 inches of vertical break during the spring. 
He dominated Double-A for a month before he was shut down with a knee injury at the end of April, and he started having shoulder issues during his rehab and didn't pitch in games for the rest of the year. He worked out in Panama during the offseason and the Guardians thought he was a full-go for spring training 2023, the start of his 40-man evaluation year. Instead it was revealed that he still had a tear in his shoulder and would miss the first few months of the year, which later turned into the entire season as Espino had surgery in May for a capsule tear, which typically takes about a year to recover from. Cleveland still put him on the 40-man roster in the offseason. Chronic shoulder issues have derailed the careers of countless pitching prospects and that's definitely in play here as it has been forever since Espino has gotten into an actual game.
Healthy Espino is a physical freak with exceptional talent and drive, and his continued presence on the 100 for the last couple of years is as much a bet on his demeanor and makeup as it is his ability. More striking than his velocity itself is the ease with which Espino generated it. Even as he has become more and more muscular entering his 20s, he has maintained a freaky level of flexibility, which he supposedly attains by stretching four times per day. His slider can bend in as hard as 94 mph and has late, two-plane finish. It would be an above-average pitch were it simply in the low-to-mid 80s, but at this velocity, it's a 70-grade weapon, and Espino has consistent feel for locating it down and to his glove side. His curveball has 12-6 shape and plus depth and power, used as a way of garnering called early-count strikes, and the speed with which he has developed two distinct breaking balls despite pitching just one full minor league season is incredible. The curve has enough depth to have bat-missing utility below the zone and generate groundballs even when hitters sniff it out mid-air. Espino barely throws his low-90s changeup, but he still has good feel for locating it in an enticing location away from lefty batters, and even that and his rarely-used curveball (combined, he threw those pitches 8% of the time in 2021) could be above average at maturity. He has top-of-the-rotation stuff, but the injuries make it more likely that Cleveland proactively moves him to the bullpen.","WCe2LI0RvgA","sa3011495"

He slashed a combined .308/.393/.539 with 60 extra-base hits and ended his season with a month at Double-A and then a great Fall League stint. His swing is gorgeous — it often looks like a mini version of Corey Seager's cut, completely connected from the ground up. It allows Pauley to execute a pull-and-lift approach that produced 23 homers in 2023. He can yank pitches across most of the zone to his pull side (Pauley's style of hitting is similar to Brandon Lowe's), though the very outer edge of the zone eludes him. 
The one thing standing between Pauley and the Top 100 list is his infield defense, which is currently untenable. Pauley struggles to make strong, accurate throws to first base, and he appears to be trending off of third and toward some combination of second base and left field. The Padres' need in left field might prompt even more spring experimentation with Pauley out there since he's among the best internal offensive options to fill that void. If he can find a true home on defense, he'll move into the Top 100 list during the 2024 season, provided Pauley isn't pressed into big league action by then.",,"sa3019858"

He was peaking in the 97-99 mph range early on, then was sitting in the upper 80s during his final two starts of the year, per Synergy. He is so slight of build (Triston McKenzie is a fair frame/body comp) that I was concerned Mazur would have long-term issues holding his peak velocity as a starter throughout a full pro season. So far, so good, however, as Mazur held a 93-95 mph fastball across 96 innings in 2023, finishing his season at Double-A San Antonio. 
Perhaps even more impressive was that Mazur issued walks at a miniscule 4.3% clip all year. Watch Mazur pitch and he shows you more control than command. His entire mechanical operation, which is very graceful and athletic, hurdles his skinny body toward the plate, and Mazur peppers the strike zone with all of his pitches. His in-zone command is a little loose, though. Hopefully with time he'll be able to locate his fastball to the upper third of the zone more consistently, up where the line on his fastball is tough for hitters to mirror. He too often leaves his fastball or slider in the meat of the zone where both are vulnerable, and this is why Mazur projects as more of a no. 4/5 starter at present than a contender's mid-rotation weapon. Mazur doesn't technically have to be put on the Padres' 40-man roster until after the 2025 season, but considering that he's had half a season of success at Double-A and is within range of a five-and-dive big league starter's innings count — and given San Diego's need for pitching — it's feasible he could be up this year. If the Padres want to keep him around 120 innings in 2024, he could begin the season on a slight delay to backload those innings into September and (hopefully) October.",,"sa3020815"

He first appeared on the International Players section of The Board last year when he posted the second-highest swinging strike rate in NPB behind Livan Moinelo (a name to stash away for next offseason). Despite sitting mostly 91-94 throughout the season, he ranked fourth in K% in 2023 among pitchers who threw at least 40 innings (32.4%) because his fastball misses a ton of bats at the letters thanks to its flat approach angle and vertical movement. The supremely athletic 5-foot-8 lefty has a due north arm slot that helps impart a nearly perfect back spinning axis on his fastball. Sometimes pitchers with this high a slot end up having a steep, downhill fastball angle, but Matsui's lack of size helps counterbalance that, and his bouncy on-mound athleticism should enable him to hold up across a typical 60-inning big league relief workload despite being so small. 
As pedestrian as Matsui's fastball velocity is, his splitter is quite firm (usually 86-88 mph). It's his most-used secondary pitch; his usage of it has increased in each of the last several seasons and grew to a career-high 35% in 2023. Matsui also has a true two-plane mid-80s slider that is of big league quality, but his usage of it was cut nearly in half in 2023, way down to 10%. It’s a good looking pitch and probably deserves more air time. Despite lacking typical big league reliever arm strength, Matsui looks like a very stable and versatile big league middle reliever. I've gassed his FV a little bit above my typical 40 FV for a role like this because Matsui's mix should enable him to get hitters of both handednesses out. He lacks the monstrous stuff I associate with a contender's set-up man or closer, but he's more than a generic sixth-inning guy.","p23yG-9wJ18","sa3023348"

His underlying contact and chase data is very promising (6.5% swinging strike rate, 88.5% Z-contact%, 16% chase rate) and Marsee runs well enough to consider him a viable (but flawed, perhaps fringe-y) option in center field, but I'm struggling to get wholly on board here. Marsee is barrel chested and stocky, a bit stiff, and I think he has some plate coverage issues (big velo up/away) that have yet to be exposed by (mostly) A-ball pitching. Marsee is a short-levered pull hitter capable of doing damage versus pitches on the very inner edge of the plate, and I think pitchers can neutralize his power by staying away from him. Purely from an eyeball scouting standpoint, Marsee looks like he'll peak as a fourth outfielder. His statistical case is much stronger than that.

He worked about 120 total innings combined between his minor league and major league outings in 2023, pitching as a starter at Triple-A Scranton but working in a variable role for the Yankees prior to the Juan Soto trade. The high-effort nature of his delivery, his lack of size, and his below-average command all put him in the long-term relief bucket a little more definitively than the other pitchers San Diego acquired for Soto, including 2023 rookie graduate, Jhonny Brito.
Vásquez sits 93–95 mph and has a four-pitch mix headlined by his trademark breaking ball, which has wowed scouts for the past half decade or so. In a sense, he is the replacement for Seth Lugo, another curveball-heavy righty who spent his entire career on the starter/reliever line before the Padres correctly predicted he’d be able to start. Vásquez is just so tightly wound and mechanically violent, however, that I'm not comfortable projecting him as a long-term starter. Because of San Diego’s needs and the flexibility that his two remaining option years provide, I’d expect him to be sixth or seventh on the Padres’ Opening Day rotation depth chart and be up and down as needed throughout the year.

While aspects of his swing make him vulnerable to breaking balls on the outer third, Nimmala is able to create big power in a relatively short distance, and his swing isn't overly noisy or hard to maintain. He has a tendency to pull off of stuff bending away from him and struck out much more than expected during his senior spring, enough that he slid from near the top of Eric's draft rankings to the back of the first round based on his spring look. After the draft, Arjun had trouble picking up breaking balls in pro ball. There are past examples of players who were suddenly K-prone as seniors and had things still work out (Nolan Gorman), while there are others for whom the strikeouts proved to be a meaningful signal (Keoni Cavaco). At his size, Nimmala is more likely to end up at third base than he is to stay at shortstop, which means he has very little hit tool margin for error. The skill foundation here is still very exciting, though. Nimmala's age and power combination is incredibly rare, and his upside hasn't changed, but as time has drawn on, the perception about his likelihood to reach it has.

Barger dealt with an elbow issue in 2023 and was limited to just shy of 90 games, and he didn't perform quite as well as in 2022. Still, by the end of the year, we were confident he felt no ill effects from the elbow because Barger's superhuman arm strength and cacophonous swing were both intact. His hack is a spectacle, lots of fun when he's on time and frustrating when he's late, utilizing a narrow, open stance and a huge leg kick. Barger can really cut it loose and is a threat to do damage on every swing, but his style is going to lead to plenty of strikeouts. 
Barger's defensive forecast has slid down the spectrum a bit, and we now think he'll play a combination of 3B and RF rather than the middle infield (which he still played some of in 2023). We think he'll be fine (but not great) at third and are excited about his potential defensive impact in right field because of his arm (which also hides some of his infield ills).

With veterans Francisco Lindor and Jeff McNeil occupying the middle infield spots, Mauricio was likely going to battle Brett Baty and Mark Vientos for playing time at third base, which was his primary position with Licey before he was injured. The Mets began to play him all over the place in 2023 (including in left field) looking for pathways to playing time, as they were clogged at many positions and Mauricio was hitting well at Triple-A. He slashed .292/.346/.506 (a 108 wRC+, which gives you an idea of the run environment), and Mauricio had his third consecutive season with at least 20 homers, his second consecutive 20/20 campaign, and was fresh off winning the LIDOM MVP the winter before. 
Mauricio is a huge-framed switch-hitting shortstop with power from both sides of the plate and a rocket arm, but his swing decisions are often so reckless that even though he's met expectations since his high-profile signing, he's still an extremely volatile prospect. Because he's gotten stronger and added huge power while remaining just agile enough to play shortstop, his chase issues are palatable. Mauricio has historically had a chase rates near 40% and has a career .311 OBP in the minors. His secondary pitch recognition isn't good, and he's very vulnerable to soft stuff in the bottom of the zone and below. There are some players who are as aggressive as Mauricio (or more so) who find a way to be impact big leaguers anyway, and almost all of them tend to make enough in-zone contact to buoy their overall offensive output. Ronny Mo is on the very edge of viability in this respect, with in-zone contact rates of 83-85% the last few seasons, which is right around what successful chase-prone, low-OBP hitters like Ozzie Albies and Jonathan Schoop have shown. Hopefully a year of relative inactivity doesn't impact Mauricio's defensive ability so much that he can't play shortstop anymore, as his capability there is an important aspect of his profile. A projected typical slash line for Mauricio looks like juiced ball-era Freddy Galvis, low OBP seasons with 25-to-30 homers and plus infield defense. ","NvOA8y_cZGI","23698"

He looked nasty in a college summer league prior to the draft and buoyed his prospects. The Dodgers further harnessed his stuff — at best he was 94-97 with two plus breaking balls, and Nastrini put up impressive strikeout numbers at High- and Double-A in 2022. He was evaluated just outside the Top 100 prospects list that year, kept off by his poor control. When Nastrini returned to Double-A in 2023, at this time still with the Dodgers, his strikeout fell by nearly 10 percentage points, and he did nothing to allay concerns about his command. Positioned as a Pick to Click, his performance plateaued. Even while his numbers sagged, his swinging strike rate was still among the best in the minor leagues, and sure enough his overall numbers improved again after he was traded to the White Sox as part of the deal that sent Lance Lynn and Joe Kelly to the Dodgers. 
Nastrini's fastball alone will enable him to miss bats thanks to consistent mid-90s velocity and a healthy dose of vertical break. His robust arsenal of secondaries play well off one another. He’ll call upon his heater to miss bats, confounding hitters on both sides of the plate with its rise and cut. Then he’ll further frustrate his opponents with two distinct breaking balls – a slider and a curveball with drastically different shapes and velocities – or his changeup, which mirrors his slider in a way that makes it very effective against lefties. His entire arsenal is more vertical than horizontal, with all three secondaries featuring varying degrees of drop that allow them to complement one another. 
But his command is still the sticking point, as the offerings he tosses out of the zone are usually big misses rather than strategically placed attempts to get chase swings. If he can hone that command, he could comfortably slot in towards the middle of a starting rotation, but if he can't, he'll still be impactful as a single-inning, late-game reliever. The White Sox have the luxury of letting Nastrini try to start for as long as possible during the early stages of their rebuild. Things might be bumpy early on, but over time a guy whose stuff is this good will find a way to be an impact pitcher of some stripe.","66ndZ5SD8O4","sa3017413"

He spent all of 2023 at Double-A Erie, where he chugged through 118 innings with a 29.7% K% and slightly discouraging 10.2% walk rate. After he was a north/south arm slot guy in college, Madden and the Tigers have worked to alter his delivery over the course of the last couple of seasons. His arm slot has come down more and more as he has adopted a more three-quarters slot, as well as more overt drop-and-drive usage in his lower half. The results have mostly been encouraging, as the shallower angle this creates on his fastball has fostered more in-zone bat-missing ability and better natural action on a changeup that needed to develop for Madden to hit his ceiling. 
I think that some of his uncharacteristic wildness in 2023 was simply from this delivery being relatively new. Madden's walk rate was high, but he has pitchability elements. He can manipulate breaking ball shape and either throw his slider for a strike or bury it for whiffs, he has a low-90s cutter that he's still getting a feel for, and he knows where in the zone his fastball plays. Even in his final start of the year, Madden was parked in the 94-95 mph range.

Jimenez, who has been on the Jays 40-man for two years, owns a .388 career OBP in the minors. He likely won't sustain quite that level of bat-to-ball performance against big league arms, but this is his carrying tool on offense. Jimenez checks some, but not all, of our visual scouting boxes for contact excellence.

Santiago Espinal (two options left) is the one most directly blocking Jimenez on the Jays' depth chart as the team's best-gloved utilityman. Ideally, Jimenez would branch out beyond just his usual 2B/SS in 2024 and be rostered as a utilityman within the next year.

He's compactly built and not especially strong, but Rincon tracks pitches well, rarely chases, and moves the bat around the zone from both sides of the plate.

The latter issue is small enough to project that it will get cleaned up with time. Otherwise, Rincon's cut is short and to the point but still has a fair amount of natural lift. 
A high-probability utility prospect in the Geraldo Perdomo mold, Rincon has terrific soft skills, and his ceiling will be dictated by how much stronger he can get. Because we're not talking about a super projectable frame in this case, I'm not inclined to forecast a huge uptick in that realm, but the progression of Rincon's measurable power from 2022 to 2023 (16% hard-hit rate to 25%, with a max exit velo that rose nearly 10 ticks to 108 mph) was pretty substantial.",,"sa3020221"

His rehab was interrupted by an ill-timed foot fracture, which kept him off the mound until midway through the 2023 season, after which old co-workers Kenny Williams and Kim Ng swapped Jake Burger for Eder at the trade deadline.

His fastball still has some top-of-the-zone whiff ability thanks to its shape and angle, but that pitch isn't nearly as dominant as it was before he blew out. His slider is still a stunner, however, bending in at 77-81 mph with plus-plus break. Eder was clearly working on his changeup, especially after the trade and in the Fall League, where he used it in a left-on-left capacity a lot of the time.

He has demonstrated rare durability for a pitcher with just two full pro seasons under his belt, working about 120 innings each of the last two seasons while maintaining mid-90s velocity. 
Hamel has had elevated walk rates for his whole career because of his approach to pitching. Inefficiency is inherent in the way his fastball plays best, at the belt and above, where it's tough for hitters to get on top of it. Hamel also has two good breaking balls, both of which play best when working in sequence with these high fastballs. Though his slider doesn't finish down and away from the zone with great consistency, it's nasty enough that the ones that back up can still freeze hitters. Hamel's mid-70s rainbow curveball (it sits 73-77; the sliders sometimes have curveball shape but are consistently 80 mph and above) has cartoonish depth and is tough for hitters to square even if they spot it popping out of his hand. Hamel's changeup usage waxes and wanes, and increased late in 2023. It has enough sink to be a viable fourth pitch, something that can steal the occasional strike or get a groundball. He also seemed to introduce a cutter (which currently isn't good) to his repertoire in 2023. 
Like quite a few upper-level Mets prospects, Hamel is a bit more advanced than his chalk 40-man roster timeline. He could absolutely debut in 2024 if the Mets have enough big league injuries, since he'll likely be at Triple-A all year.

But he stayed healthy all year in 2023 and nearly doubled what had previously been his highest innings total for a season, jumping from just 38.1 innings in 2022 to 86 innings in 2023 (both at High-A). 
He is on the shorter side for a pitcher, with very short arms even for his size, and he’s lowered his arm slot since being drafted, enhancing the deception he creates from his uphill lefty delivery, and making it difficult for hitters to adjust to it. His signature secondary is his curveball, which is cartoonishly slow – the kind of loopy offering Bugs Bunny would get three whiffs on before the ball reached the catcher. Even so, it features so much depth that while it’s relatively easy to identify out of his hand, its shape often prevents hitters from connecting with it. He uses his slider more often than the curveball – in fact, his slider usage has at times rivaled his fastball, with both sitting near 40%. The shape of the slider isn’t as impressive as that of the curveball, but it sits in the mid-80s, splitting the difference between his curve and his 92-94 mph fastball. With a low-80s changeup added to his arsenal, he is armed with a four-pitch mix with enough velocity separation to be very effective when Macko’s command is working for him. The command is inconsistent, though, and seeing as how the effectiveness of his mix depends on it, it's an area in need of major improvement if Macko wants to find his way into a big league starting rotation. Still, we think he's going to be a valuable weapon on a pitching staff even if he ends up as a long reliever. He's now on Toronto's 40-man roster, but it wouldn't surprise us if he spent his first option year entirely in the minors with an eye on increasing his per-outing and whole-season innings count.","2nbX61Y4TeM","sa3011555"

Like a lot of pitchers who leave Virginia, Vasil has had a rebound in pro ball. He's back to sitting 92-95 and reaching back for 96-97, velocity he's held for the last two seasons. His slider has also gotten much harder, up from 82-83 in college to his present 85-88 mph range at peak. Vasil will flash an above-average changeup and his curveball's shape is much different than that of his slider. Much more about control than precise command, Vasil's craftsmanship as a pitcher is still a bit of a mixed bag. For instance, he throws a ton of strikes but tends to live in the very middle of the zone with both his fastball and slider. He'll ideally polish his feel for locating those pitches at the letters and on the glove-side edge of the plate, respectively.

His hands, actions, quick transfer, internal clock, and arm accuracy all made him a likely pro shortstop despite him lacking the traditional speed/range and max-effort arm of a big league shortstop, but now that Gonzalez's physicality has begun to change, he might take a leap in those areas. Skinny Jacob often needed to wind up his whole body in order to swing hard, but now that he looks stronger, he may not have to make the mechanical concessions that left him vulnerable at the belt.

While he doesn't throw especially hard, his low arm slot gives him some ability to climb the ladder with his fastball and miss bats even at 91-94 mph, though this approach is probably going to make him prone to fly balls and homers. Our fear that righties are going to tee off on his fastball was enough to keep Gasser off the Top 100 prospects list and has us projecting him more as a contender's backend starter who probably gets shifted into the bullpen in the playoffs. 
During the regular season, Gasser's skills are still going to be very valuable. He has a master's degree in pitch sequencing and the east/west command to weaponize it. His slider has big, lengthy sweep, and his fastballs and cutters interact with one another in ways that confound hitters and cause a lot of awkward swings. Gasser's changeup has not developed as we would typically hope/project for such an athletic and loose lefty, which is another reason we slid him below the cut line of the Top 100 even though he dominated Triple-A in 2023. All of his good pitches have glove-side action except the two-seam variant of Gasser's fastball, which is pretty vulnerable when located to his arm side. Gasser is going to be a valuable big league starter but probably not an impact one.",,"sa3017310"

The added velocity came with (and was likely because of) a full-time move to the bullpen, and Rodriguez posted a 1.15 ERA in his 54 innings. Then Rodriguez pitched for Cuba's 2023 WBC team as a starter. After a rough-looking February tuneup before the actual competition began, he was nasty across 65-to-70 pitches in each of his two WBC starts, when Yariel sat 95, touched 98, and bent in a good vertical breaking ball in the 83-87 mph range. After his WBC performance, Rodriguez chose to opt out of the 2023 NPB season and focus on training to come to MLB the following year. Chunichi put him on the restricted list and Rodriguez wasn’t heard from until October, when he threw live BP for teams in the Dominican Republic and looked like his usual self. 
There may be teams that view Rodriguez as a potential MLB starter because of his repertoire depth and brief success in the WBC, but hold your horses. He started for multiple seasons in Japan and wasn't very good, with a FIP near 5.00 in 2021 prompting a bullpen move the following year. He only came into impact velocity once he moved to the 'pen and there is zero evidence that he'd be able to sustain it as a starter, in fact quite the contrary. As a relief candidate, Rodriguez is exciting and has the stuff to pitch in higher-leverage innings. His vertical fastball/breaking ball combo looks similar to Peter Fairbanks' stuff (minus a few ticks of velo) and is on par with the second- or third- best reliever coming out of a contender's bullpen.","kFqDEzmdPrc","sa3023349"

Melton reworked his arm action, had a great fourth year as an Aztec, and climbed into the fourth round of the 2022 draft. Melton was mostly drafted because he has a live arm and his mechanical adjustments made his fastball less hittable; the Tigers were tasked with developing the rest. They've begun to. Melton made substantial alterations to his slider in 2023, as the pitch picked up roughly five ticks of velocity compared to his college breaker. At times, it has devastating two-plane sweep. 
There are an awful lot of late-bloomer traits here, as Melton was young for his graduating class, was mostly a catcher in high school, missed a season due to the pandemic, and now has a fairly new delivery and a very new breaking ball. I love Melton's bounding, down-the-mound mechanics and his athleticism (big lower half bend and hip/shoulder separation here), and I think he may just be scratching the surface as a craftsman. Even though there are pitchers with similar or currently better stuff who are closer to the big leagues, I consider Melton's chances of holding down a rotation spot for a contender down the road to be greater. If he continues developing at the rate he did in 2023, he'll be a top 100 prospect a year from now.",,"sa3020652"

His velo fell, as did his draft stock, and Cannon went back to school to rebound. It worked. He had a very efficient 2022 season in terms of strike-throwing and ended up becoming Chicago's third rounder, signing for just shy of a million bucks. 
Cannon spent 2023 split between High- and Double-A and continued to throw a ton of strikes with heavy, sink-oriented stuff. He mixes four- and two-seamers at mostly 94-95 mph, and can climb the ladder when he wants. Aside from his rarely used changeup, all of Cannon's secondary pitches have glove-side movement. His mix is super tough on righties, but he needs to sharpen his backfoot breaking ball consistency to have a platoon-neutralizing weapon. Even at his size, Cannon's delivery is consistent and repeatable. He's remade his body almost entirely since early in college and looks more lean and athletic than ever before. He likely won't have monstrous bat-missing ability. but Cannon is a high-floored no. 4/5 starter prospect thanks to his repertoire depth and command.

His father played basketball at St. Francis College and Lalane accrued experience at PG tournaments in the US when he was a child. He didn't commit to pitching until he was 14-years old. A half decade later, Lalane dominated the complex level across a meager 21.1 innings in 2023, with 34 strikeouts and just four walks. He made about a start per week throughout July and most of August, working three or four innings at most. That's important context through which to view Lalane's impressive stuff, and an important thing to know as it pertains to his developmental timeline. The Yankees have two seasons to get him in position for a 40-man add (he's Rule 5 eligible after the 2025 season), and he has a real shot to earn a spot immediately. That means upping his innings count considerably over the next two years (we can probably ballpark Lalane at something like a combined 45 innings between extended spring/FCL/backfield work in 2023) to get him in position to be a rosterable 40-man guy at age 21. 
We're going to learn a lot about Lalane's ability to handle that in 2024, when he'll likely go to full-season ball for the first time. His fastball averaged 93-94 mph on the complex and he tended to live in the 91-95 mph range during his longer outings. There are a lot of young A.J. Puk (body) and Dax Fulton (everything) similarities happening here. Lalane has advanced strike-throwing ability across his repertoire. His delivery is balanced and graceful for an athlete his size, his whole operation hurdles his body toward the plate, and he routinely locates his fastball and changeup where he wants. At this size, it's plausible Lalane could continue to throw harder as he gets stronger, and he's probably going to need to in order to have a bat-missing fastball because, like Fulton, the downhill trajectory of Lalane's fastball causes it to play down. His entire skill set is more about feel and command than nasty pure stuff right now. I'm projecting that there will eventually be a finishing breaking ball here because the ball doesn't pop out of hand from Lalane's release point, but for now, he just has a looking-strike curveball. In a typical draft, a guy like Lalane is going in the comp round or early second, with Fulton acting as a fantastic barometer in this regard, and I have his FV grade centered in that area. His ceiling is going to be dictated by the velocity he can develop during the next two years or so.",,"sa3016066"

After slashing .315/.377/.453 as a Rough Rider, Acuña was part of the Max Scherzer deal, and his surface performance tanked rather surprisingly as soon as he arrived in Binghamton while his peripherals (18% K%, 9% BB%) remained roughly the same. Even when Acuña has hit well in the past, he has had issues with chase and plate coverage. Remarkable bat speed, which generates surprising power for a hitter his size, was what made Acuña a potential impact shortstop who lived toward the back of the Top 100 list.  The way his body rotates about his hips as he swings is beautiful, and he has a certain verve and power potential that few 5-foot-8 hitters possess, but Acuña has only performed for fits and starts of the last couple of seasons, and his explosion and twitch were not as apparent after he arrived in Binghamton. 
That extended to Acuña's defense. His arm strength is only fair for shortstop, and Acuña's hands on defense can be clumsy. He's mostly played the middle infield, but prior to the trade the Rangers also gave him some reps in center field and it's possible Acuña's best chance of playing a premium position well would be for the Mets to give that a go, as he certainly runs well enough for it. I was surprised at how different Acuña looked on tape in September compared to June or July, and frankly I'm a little flummoxed as to where to value him. His end-of-season look wasn't great, and it'd be tough for a second base-only defender to profile with a hit/power combination like that. Priced into this grade is the possibility of a bounce back, that the change of scenery was simply something Acuña needed to adjust to late last year and that he'll be a more dangerous hitter in 2024.","LZ-D5h0ZtAY","sa3008765"

He still has issues with fastball quality (due to sinking shape and movement) and command, which is why I don't have Kerkering projected as a slam-dunk contender's set-up man (45 FV) or better. Even with premium, upper-90s fastball velocity, Kerkering is more apt to lean on his incredible sweeper than his heater, which generated closer to an average miss rates all year despite its velocity. His slider is incredible and can be used as a vertical in-zone pitch or as a two-plane, glove-side monster. There aren't enough strikes here for me to consider Kerkering to be one of the two best relievers in a bullpen if you're trying to contend, but he fits as a third banana.",,"31776"

Morales also has explosive power to his pull side and can already put balls out to dead center field at age 17. Unlike a lot of lanky teenage hitters, Morales' bat-to-ball performance in amateur events was statistically strong. On film, his hands have a late, deep move that I worry will make him late against pro velocity, but it's too early to care much about that. Morales bends well for an athlete of his size and build, and he has a decent shot to stay at shortstop. While he's a skill fit there, it's plausible that sheer size will force him to move in his early-to-mid-20s. Likely to spend the entire 2024 calendar year in the D.R., we won't have a scouting update on Morales until deep into the summer when he's accumulated some amount of pro data and put at least a few games on available tape.",,

He spent a fair bit of his 2023 whole-season debut on the shelf with a non-displaced fracture of his left shoulder, which may have impacted his offensive output upon return. Brown hit .255/.358/.354 in 2023, mostly at High-A, and then had a stronger Fall League look (.297/.391/.462). 
Brown's unique swing has been toned down a bit since college but is still entertaining and strange, as his hands start up around his face (they used to be directly over top of his head) with his bat pointing toward the third base coach. He's such a compact, short-levered athlete that he's usually on time to make contact despite his swing's noise, and Brown performed about as well as hoped from a bat-to-ball standpoint in 2023, with a 90% z-contact rate. He's especially adept at making contact with high pitches and was executing a pull-and-lift approach in the AFL. Brown's T-Rex arms can make it tough for him to cover the down/away portion of the zone, and he's going to need to close his stride and bend in the lower body to get to those pitches. He struggles with this, and his tendency to play upright extends to his defense at shortstop, which is flashy but inconsistent. Brown simply isn't a very good bender — his range and creativity are fantastic, but there are certain plays he makes too slowly because of a lack of lower body flexibility. 
There will probably need to be adjustments in order for Brown to hit his ceiling, but his contact ability and aspects of his athleticism are pretty special. I think he'll be a Jon Berti type of utilityman even if some of his current issues remain, and if Brown solves them, he has a regular shortstop's skill set.","hYA_nIRHo0I","sa3019923"

They did so knowing he'd need Tommy John, which he had shortly after signing. Finally back in the fall of 2020, Zulueta was topping out in the 94-96 mph range at Toronto's facilities in Florida, then threw even harder in the spring of 2021, when he sat 96-99 as a non-roster invitee with the big club. He made it all of three pitches into his first start before he tore a ligament in his knee, needed surgery, and missed the remainder of the season. The 2022 season was Zulueta's 40-man evaluation year and the Blue Jays pushed him very aggressively up the minor league ladder (as a starter), such that he made starts at each full-season minor league level, including Triple-A. We pretty confidently projected Zulueta in the bullpen last year and he made it about a month into the 2023 season before the Jays moved him there, which was a refreshing departure from the org that kept starting Nate Pearson even while their big league bullpen could have used a weapon like that. 
While Zulueta's delivery isn't especially violent, it also isn't especially graceful or smooth, and his feel for location is bad enough that we worry he won't hit the late-inning ceiling that his stuff suggests he has. It was a little disappointing that he didn't experience a velo boost out of the bullpen and sat ""merely"" 94-97 yet again. Yosver's raw slider quality is incredible, but its consistency is not; automatic pitch tagging thinks he has three different breaking balls because the shape of it varies so much. Zulueta's early-career injuries once provided reason to project on his command and consistency, but he'll soon be 26, and while we still believe he's going to be a meaningfully good reliever, there's growing risk that his command will make him frustrating for long stretches at a time. We liken him to Daniel Bard, without quite as Shakespearean a career.","yXnObtaHqUc","sa3014869"

His footwork in the box is often poorly timed and Mayea's hands load deep and late, causing him to push an inordinate amount of contact the opposite way. It's not a terrible place to start, but there does have to be adjustment and improvement in this area for Mayea to be an impact offensive player. His speed and defense are both plus, as Mayea puts down some jailbreak times in the 4.1s, and his reads and routes are decisive and polished.

In 2023, at age 20, he was the youngest pitcher in baseball to reach Triple-A, but most of his season was spent at Double-A Birmingham, where he posted one of the lowest swinging strike rates in the minors. Despite the miniscule swinging strike rate, his overall K% was around league average, though at roughly 11%, his walk rate was uncomfortably high. To the eye Mena has better command than that, but he usually has to leave the strike zone to miss bats, in particular with his much-touted curveball. He and the White Sox have seemingly built his repertoire around his talent for spinning the ball. He has added a slider to his mix as a professional, and when it’s working, its shape is tighter and more horizontal than the curveball, at times looking more like a cutter. His breaking ball velocities sometimes blur together. That said, he places both pitches with enough precision to miss bats aplenty, despite their similarities. Mena’s changeup is most effective when it can play off of the slider (the two pitches look similar out of hand and then diverge in completely opposite directions), but its shape doesn’t feature much by way of horizontal movement, and he throws it so hard (in the high 80s) that it sometimes blurs with his low-90s fastball. 
We're still betting big on Mena's long-term strike-throwing efficiency and changeup quality because his delivery is so beautiful, effortless, and consistent. If we end up over-projecting, it will be because Mena has to nibble with his ineffective fastball. It has below average velocity and movement, and has been frighteningly hittable against upper-level batters; between Double- and Triple-A, batters slashed .318/.420/.573 against his heater in 2023. He’s still so young and very athletic, and Mena's 2023 134-inning workload is superlative for a pitcher his age. If his fastball can add a couple ticks (his arm slot <em>should</em> help his heater have more carry than it does) and improve its playability, then we're talking about a mid-rotation starter and top 100 prospect. If not, then Mena has more of a backend starter profile.","llrpZ44a_wU","sa3015302"

His velocity has slowly been ticking down since then, and he sat mostly 92-94 in 2023 as he made 21 regular season starts (interrupted by a hammy strain) and then did a mix of starting and relieving in yet another Fall League. 
His fastball still has in-zone bat-missing ability thanks to its other traits, but it isn't the dominant offering of late 2021. Flores still has two good-looking breaking balls — a spike curveball and a cutter — that looked better to my eye in Arizona than they played on paper during the regular season. His knuckle curve's shape plays nicely off his fastball, and Flores' cutter/slider has above-average length, but varies in shape. He threw changeups at an 8% clip during the summer, but I didn't see one in Arizona. He's now on the 40-man, but the Tigers don't need to rush a decision as to whether or not Flores is a starter or multi-inning reliever. He has all three option years left, and they have a fairly deep group of starters ahead of him after adding Jack Flaherty and Kenta Maeda in free agency. If you could guarantee me that Flores' fastball would sit in the mid-90s if he was allowed to air it out an inning or two at a time, I'd prefer that to the low-90s starter version of him. I'm projecting him in relief here, but again, the Tigers have the depth and flexibility to see how things go with Flores as a starter for another year.","HBewrbdcaII","sa3015223"

If you had told me a year ago that Ramírez was going to partially remedy his free-swinging approach in 2023, I would have told you that he'd had a breakout that placed him among the top 50 or so prospects in baseball. Instead, even though his swing rate dropped five percentages points and his chase rate dropped seven, Ramírez had a mediocre year marred by poor quality of contact and struggles against fastballs. The exciting buggy whip bat speed that made Ramírez a top 100 prospect last year is still present, but the amount of movement and length it takes to get his barrel going has become a problem, or at least I've now realized that it's a problem. 
One other issue here is that Ramírez is becoming tougher to project in center field. Even though he mostly played center in 2023 and has the ball skills to play there, his routes are not crisp and Ramírez is only running 4.3 from home to first, which is a slower than is typical for a good center field defender. His wispy frame has room for another 20 or maybe 30 pounds, and with that weight and strength could come more raw power, but it will also probably be the nail in the center field coffin. There is still sizable long-term upside here if all the power arrives, but my Jose Siri, streaky late-bloomer comp of the last couple of years is evaporating due to changes in my defensive projection for Ramírez, whose overall stock has begun to teeter.","8u-cBOEpR_M","sa3014695"

Burrowes can move the barrel around the zone fairly well, but he is often late to the ideal point of contact, and he doesn't seem to recognize spin well. His 6.7% walk rate on the complex last year would ordinarily be a bright red flag, but his underlying chase data, while still not great, isn't quite as terrifying.

He punched out 50 hitters in his first 37 innings and worked efficiently enough to pitch into the fifth and sixth inning during several starts, a rarity for him at Miami. After his June 10 start, however, the Phillies began to drastically limit the length of McFarlane's outings, his stuff waned, and he was ultimately shut down at the end of August. A source close to the situation told me McFarlane had Tommy John during the offseason (I'm not sure of the exact date), which will put him out for all of 2024. 
Healthy 2025 McFarlane could enjoy a Kerkering-like rise through the minors, especially if the Phillies decide to 'pen him. When he was totally healthy early in 2023, McFarlane was sitting 98-100 mph, then he backed into the 94-97 range closer to when he was shut down. His monster arm strength helps make up for his fastball's tailing shape, created by McFarlane's nearly side-arm delivery. His gyro slider induced a plus-plus 21% swinging strike rate against A-ball hitters (an important caveat) in 2023, and McFarlane also has a rare changeup that he threw fewer than 50 times last season. 
There were good reasons for the Phillies to try to develop him as a starter. Miami doesn't seem to max out their pitchers on campus, and McFarlane's fastball featured better sink in pro ball. He also has a great pitcher's frame and is a fabulous on-mound athlete. But now that he's going to miss all of 2024 and enter his 40-man evaluation season (2025) with so few innings under his belt, it's much more likely McFarlane is moved quickly as a potential late-inning weapon, assuming his stuff comes back after his rehab.",,"sa3020633"

He held mid-90s velo all year, throwing 93 innings in his first full season removed from Tommy John.

He made a strong argument to be included on the Top 100 Prospects list, but Frasso hurt his shoulder at the very end of the season and needed labrum surgery in November.

Compounding those worries are Frasso's mechanics, which are entertaining as hell to watch but not typical of a big league starter. He has a deceptive cross-body delivery that generates huge extension, like a stiffer and less graceful Freddy Peralta. Frasso's command has been solid in spite of his mechanical weirdness and he has the stuff of a mid-rotation starter, but the injuries feel like a harbinger of sorts. As such, Frasso is tough to ""value."" If you wanted to tack him immediately behind Daniel Espino on the universal prospect list you could, which is essentially what's been done here.","pngHh7McrL4","sa3014492"

He spent all of 2023 at High-A, where he improved in every column of his triple-slash line, while striking out just 10.7% of the time and nearly matching that in walks, this time over a full season. His 5.2% swinging strike rate was the among the very lowest in all of the minor leagues, further illustrating his knack for getting his bat on the ball, but his minute barrel rate adds clarifying detail. Kasevich’s contact skews heavily toward singles, mostly comprised of flare popups and well-placed soft line drives to the shallow part of the outfield, making him a hyper-realized contact-over-power prospect. Defensively, Kasevich has mostly spent time at shortstop (his college position), but his range and arm utility are iffy fits there, in particular grounders to his right. He’s better moving to his glove-side, which seems conducive to a possible move to third base, where he also notched a substantial number of innings in 2023 and is likely to see more time going forward as the Jays reckon with a potentially Matt Chapman-less future.

He is coming off a season where he slashed .280/.391/.436 at Double-A Tulsa prior to a late-season swoon at Oklahoma City. Vivas is still short but he's no longer small, as over the last couple of years his back, shoulders, arms, and thighs have all buffed up to an impressive size. This has resulted in a modest uptick in power, and after Vivas hit just two total homers in his first couple of pro seasons, he's reached double digits in each of the last three. But Vivas' skill set is still rooted in his bat-to-ball skills, which are enhanced by his compact swing and short-levered stature. He's a dynamic in-the-box athlete who swings really hard but still makes a ton of contact, running an 88-89% in-zone contact rate each of the last two seasons. While he has experience at both second and third base, Vivas' arm strength is not typical of a big league left side infielder. Without positional versatility helping to carry him to a big league role, he looks more like a second-division second baseman who'd perform at a 1.5-ish WAR clip across a whole season of at-bats. He is stacked behind Gleyber Torres and Oswald Peraza on the Yankees depth chart, though he could be a lefty-hitting platoon partner for DJ LeMahieu if the Yankees feel the need to shake things up at third base.",,"sa3005511"

He’s fast, he has a keen eye, he plays with lots of effort, and he swings hard for a small-ish guy. He slashed .284/.417/.513 across Double- and Triple-A in 2023 and raised his career minor league line ton excellent .279/.415/.465. For the last couple of years, Black (and my forecast for him) has been fumbling around for a defensive home. He has largely played second base during the last half decade and gave center field a try in 2022, but moved to third base in 2023 and even began to get some reps at first. He actually looked pretty good at third base aside from his throwing stroke, which sometimes looks odd and lacks accuracy. It's a big enough issue that I have him projected to first base and will speculate he'll eventually play the outfield corner, as well. Black's 2023 power output was likely a caricature of his true ability. His game is grounded in his contact and (more significantly) on-base skills. He lacks the power typical of a corner infielder and I also have some reservations about his ability to carry above-average contact rates to the big leagues. Black needs a ton of effort to swing hard and his head often flies all over the place. His swing also has a hole in it (up and away) that will be probed by big league fastballs until he proves he can close it. So no, I don't have Black evaluated as an everyday player. Because he's backed into a fair bit of defensive versatility, runs well, and has a plus-plus skill in his plate discipline, he'll still have roster utility as corner role player of modest impact.","_0WzwN2Qt4o","sa3017623"

I do think he'll have some peak years where, like Rogers or Austin Hedges, Dingler gets to enough of his power to perform like an average primary catcher, but he'll likely be a runner-stopping backup for the bulk of his time as a big leaguer. Dingler began catching on one knee coming off the meniscectomy and took to it rather smoothly. He's still not a great receiver, but neither his ball-blocking nor his throwing have suffered because of the move. Dingler routinely pops in the 1.80s and uncorked an all-world 1.7-second lightning bolt to the bag in late September with Toledo.

Berroa struck out 37% of opposing hitters at Double-A Arkansas in 2023 and has the raw stuff to pitch in the back of a bullpen if he can dial in his 30-grade control.  
As the prophecy foretold, Berroa was finally moved to the bullpen after making five starts at the beginning of 2023 and joined the legion of wild arms who are now leading with their slider and using their fastball as a two-strike chase pitch. The line on his fastball, when located at the letters, sets his slider up to freeze hitters and then dive into the zone after they've given up on it. It's not going to be an efficient operation, but Berroa has plus-plus arm strength and a nasty vertical breaking ball that are both capable of missing bats.

Butto was throwing more strikes in the low minors but adopted more of a power pitcher's approach with his fastball a couple of season ago, and now tries to attack hitters at the top of the strike zone. He can beat hitters who struggle with that location, but his fastball doesn't have quite enough carry to play as a bat-misser in the meatier parts of the strike zone.

He missed all of June with an elbow injury, then returned for three starts in July, after which he was shut down for the remainder of the year with biceps soreness. Two distinct injuries to his pitching arm within such a short span of time is troubling, of course, though they help explain why his velocity was down compared to his high school look (he was in the 92-93 range in 2023). Barriera's body also changed, and during the little bit he pitched for Dunedin, he looked much heavier than he did in high school. Some of the added weight is clearly muscle, but the rate at which his conditioning has regressed is somewhat concerning. He'll barely be 20 when the 2024 season begins and has gone from looking like a Ricky Tiedemann clone in many ways to being built more like Graham Ashcraft. Because he’s still a teenager, the time and ability to trim down and/or build up his body’s fortitude to avoid injury is clearly here, but it's something to watch. 
When he was able to take the mound, he was a bit on the wild side, with an inordinate number of walks and HBPs, but that came with a 31.5% strikeout rate and a ridiculous 76.3% groundball rate, which was the highest in the minors for any pitcher with at least 20 innings. Granted, it’s doubtful he’d stay on the top of that column had he accrued more innings of work, but it’s still promising for the young southpaw. Barriera is still stylistically similar to Tiedemann: A low-slinging lefty with a lot of heat on his heater when he's healthy, a lot of sweep on his sweeper, and a promising changeup, though his high school command was not great. We're slightly discouraged by his 2023 for a number of reasons, but the ceiling here is still among the most exciting in this system. A source close to this situation told us Barriera's weight is down and that it will be an area of continued focus for him during the offseason. We're hopeful that he'll bounce back and we've mostly left his pre-draft valuation intact, but we're warning readers that we'll let air out of the balloon pretty quickly if Barriera displays some of these issues again in 2024.","RSQ5j-PDi1k","sa3020683"

Wrobleski more or less held that velo spike throughout 2023 and actually ended the year with several starts of velo increase, at times averaging 95 mph. 
Wrobo essentially has five pitches because of his ability to alter the shape and velocity of his fastball, and he's funneled his breaking ball usage away from his curveball and toward a slider/cutter combo that he commands very well. Can he sustain this more recent velo spike like he did the first one? The arrow has been pointing up slowly but steadily since Wrobleski returned from surgery.

Two years of struggles with the Commodores resulted in just 39 total at-bats before Malloy transferred to Georgia Tech for his junior year. He slashed .308/.436/.558 with more walks than strikeouts as a Yellowjacket in 2021, his only collegiate season with actual playing time. Without a clear defensive position, Malloy fell all the way to Atlanta's sixth round pick. Within a year and a half, Malloy had coasted through Double-A and a great Arizona Fall League stint with a career OBP north of .400. The Braves traded him to Detroit for Joe Jiménez during the 2022-23 offseason, and Malloy produced another huge, OBP-driven .277/.417/.474 line in 2023 with Toledo. 
While not yet on the 40-man roster, Malloy is in position to compete for big league playing time in 2024 as Detroit's third base situation evolves. Like most of the Tigers' other upper-level position player prospects, he is not a particularly good defensive infielder. After he only played the infield in college, the Braves and Tigers have given Malloy about 50 starts in the outfield corners each of the past two seasons, and while he doesn't look especially comfortable there, his air-it-out arm strength is plus. 
Malloy's thunderous hands create big power in a short distance, and he's capable of torching pull-side contact, but I don't believe he has quite enough hit tool to be a regular corner outfielder or third baseman. Big league pitchers will bully JHM in the parts of the strike zone that he struggles to cover, and in addition to the whiffs, I worry his plate skills won't shine quite like they have so far because big leaguers know they can get him out in the strike zone. His best shot at securing a meaningful big league role includes defensive versatility that isn't yet present in his skill set. 
There is still some ironing out do to on defense, but the Tigers have the luxury of another year to do it before Malloy has to be put on the 40-man, and the field of similar players ahead of him is pretty dense, which makes me think it's more likely that Malloy will debut in 2025 than in 2024.

After the Rangers promoted him, Speas' wildness cropped up again and he walked 19% of hitters at Triple-A Round Rock across 28.1 innings. The Rangers DFA'd him to make room on the 40-man for Matt Bush, who was returning from injury, and the White Sox claimed him off waivers during the postseason. Even though Speas' fastball is still topping out at an incredible 102 mph, he has begun utilizing a cutter-heavy approach because his feel for throwing that pitch for strikes is much better than any other. Those cutters tilt in anywhere from 89-95 mph with variable shape, and it can be tough to discern some of them from Speas' 85-87 mph sliders, which he throws on occasion. The velocity gains that Speas' lanky frame portended in high school have come to fruition, but because of his fastball's underlying traits and his lack of control, his pitches are only getting swinging strikes as an average rate. The White Sox are in position to give him low stakes big league reps for the next couple of seasons to see how things go. It's possible Speas will polish his elite arm strength enough to be a very good reliever over time, but initially he's probably going to be frustratingly wild.

Chicago sent him straight to Triple-A after they acquired him and, though Leasure had a high ERA there, he actually showed some developmental progress with regards to his curveball usage, which ticked up at Charlotte and then again in the Arizona Fall League. 
Make no mistake, Leasure's best pitch is his fastball, which also added a few grades worth of movement in 2023. Leasure's violent, vertical-slotted delivery generates big carry on his heater, giving it in-zone bat-missing ability. His fastball execution, both with regard to throwing strikes and the quality of them, is well below average, but the pitch is nasty enough for him to get away with that. His most-used secondary is currently a hard, upper-80s slider/cutter that has variable shape because of Leasure's mechanical inconsistency. It's a nasty, late-breaking pitch that will be an effective second weapon if he can spot it more consistently as he gets comfortable with his relatively new arm strength. I'm not sure the curveball will be able to usurp it even though it theoretically should tunnel better with his fastball. It's a 12-to-6 offering in the low-80s and looked about average in the AFL. 
A fastball like this should enable him to be more than just a generic middle reliever, but there's not quite enough secondary stuff to project Leasure as a setup man or closer on a contender. He stands a chance to work higher-leverage innings for the Sox in the coming season.",,"sa3017607"

He slayed the Florida State League for two months before back-to-back one-month stints at High-A Hudson Valley and Double-A Somerset to close out the year. Ramirez's offensive performance tapered off with each subsequent promotion and his defense remains a bit unkempt. His receiving around the edge of the zone and raw arm strength are both fine, but Ramirez is currently pretty bad at picking balls in the dirt, and his slow exit from his crouch drags his pop times down into an average range. He isn't ready to be a big league defender just yet, but he isn't so bad to that I'm projecting him to first base. This is still a young catcher with rare power at a position where players tend to break late. He needs to stop chasing sliders and pulling off ones that finish on the outer edge of the plate; Ramirez's performance against sliders was his biggest problem after arriving in Somerset. If he can improve in this regard, Ramirez has a bat-first backup catcher's floor and enough offensive talent to carve out a larger role where he also gets a start or two at DH every week. He's now on New York's 40-man roster, which is crowded with catchers, making it likely he spends all of 2024 developing his defense in the minors.",,"sa3009276"

Despite Escobar's relative physical maturity, there's power projection here based on his capacity for movement and contact quality. 
It's harder to reconcile his size with his defensive forecast. Though he's played all the infield positions but first base, it's tough for infielders with his build to stay at shortstop long-term. An agile, low-to-the ground athlete, he's a suitable infielder more in the 2B/3B mix. Here again we have a prospect whose ability to be an impact player will need to be driven by a premium hit tool, and the early indications are that this is plausible for Escobar. Given that he raked in the 2022 DSL and is more filled out that most teenage infield prospects, it was surprising to see Escobar repeat the DSL in 2023.

His changeup is still incredible, a sinking and tailing ball of vapor that generated elite miss rates again last season. His fastball also doesn't have quite enough carry to miss bats in the zone, and Stone will probably need to mix some combination of his fastball and cutter together when he isn't throwing his cambio.

He had an inconsistent full-season debut in 2021 but also showed significant growth in terms of velocity, sitting 93-95 mph. He entered 2022 as a potential breakout guy, but Blalock had Tommy John just before the season and never threw a pitch. He returned in May of 2023 and looked whole, as Blalock made 15 starts (usually going four or five innings per start) while showing pre-surgery arm strength and a better changeup. The Red Sox traded him to Milwaukee at the 2023 deadline for Luis Urías and he made just four starts in the Brewers system before his season ended with an oblique strain. Milwaukee added Blalock to their 40-man roster after the season. 
Blalock is a below-average athlete and his long-ish arm action makes his delivery look somewhat relievery, but he has four viable pitches and starter-quality command. He'll show you a mid-90s downhill heater, two distinct breaking balls (which are tough to parse from Blalock's fastball and one another), and a mid-80s changeup that succeeds because of Blalock's command of it rather than its movement. Aspects of Blalock's upright delivery that detract from his fastball's effectiveness aid in hiding his breaking balls, which he can land for a strike when he wants.

Mattison also has a vertical curveball that sometimes has some arm-side movement that makes it a weapon against both lefties and righties. He still only uses his tailing mid-80s changeup occasionally, but that pitch had an absurd miss rate against lefties in 2023, north of 50%.

His slider breaks late and his curveball has big time depth. Both of them are easily plus, while the rest of his skill set is below average. His delivery is more graceful than it is athletic and powerful (it looked like it regressed a bit at OSU), and scouts are split as to whether or not JWB is going to throw harder in pro ball. Pro teams don't consider Oklahoma State to be especially good at developing pitchers, so perhaps there's meat on the bone here, either in terms of coaxing more velo out of Watts-Brown by altering his mechanics or simply by helping him impart more effective movement on that pitch. He could be a no. 4 starter with an improved heater and more consistent release, and is more like a generic no. 5 or a reliever if he can only find one of those things.

He's a career .273/.371/.447 hitter in the low minors and has always been a little old for the level, though that began to change in 2023 when he clubbed 19 homers in 95 Low-A games and ended the year with a month at the age-appropriate High-A Hudson Valley. 
Serna is only listed at 5-foot-6, but he's long and sinewy, and he swings incredibly hard for such a small player. He also moves the barrel around the zone with uncommon feel for someone who swings with this much effort and verve. There's some chase-driven risk here. Serna is swing-happy in any count, but he gets especially antsy in two-strike counts, when he chases over 40% of the time. 
Like a lot of other interesting position player prospects in New York's system, Serna's arm strength will likely limit him to second base at the highest levels. If his swing decisions prevent him from being an everyday second baseman, any kind of versatility would make Serna more rosterable as a utilityman; he's gotten quite a few left field reps in Mexico this winter. Despite his size and age, I like Serna's power projection more than most of the other little middle infielders in the system because of his build and the ferocity with which he swings. He's got a puncher's chance to be an everyday second baseman, but he's more likely a Dylan Moore type of role player.",,"sa3015579"

He slashed .295/.366/.474 as a Diamondbacks minor leaguer prior to his offseason trade to Chicago for pitching prospect Cristian Mena. Fletcher made his big league debut in 2023 when Alek Thomas was sent back to Triple-A to rework his swing. He hit an impressive .301/.350/.441 in a 28-game big league stint, but his .263 xwOBA was considerably lower than his actual .340 mark. He has become surprisingly buff and strong for a 5-foot-9 hitter, his arms are gigantic for a person his size, and Fletcher has done so while retaining fluidity in his hips and shoulders, both of which are evident as he finishes his swing. The sweeping nature of his bat path means Fletcher does most of his extra-base damage against slow stuff he can scoop at the bottom of the zone. He inside-outs a lot of fastballs the other way, and pitchers can limit his damage by approaching him with heat. Contrary to the way he was projected in high school, he now has a power-over hit profile. 
Fletcher is an average runner from home to first and doesn't have the pure speed to play center field regularly, but his reads and routes out are good enough for him to moonlight there in an emergency.

Throw in a passable changeup and Ingram has the tools to work the middle innings — he isn't just a lefty specialist.

He does have fantastic feel for contact, however. Bergolla struck out just three times all summer in the 2022 DSL and then had the highest contact rate in the minors in 2023.

He then showed a substantial velo bump in 2023, as he averaged 95 mph across just shy of 40 affiliated innings. At a compact 6-feet tall, Martin is not built like a typical big league starter and he certainly hasn't proven he can maintain that kind of velocity across a starter's load of innings. He is, however, a pretty special on-mound athlete with a lovely arm action, and his fastball's underlying characteristics and movement (some which are aided by Martin's lack of size) should help it play even when Martin doesn't have peak velocity. Additionally, Martin has the makings of a fantastic breaking pitch in his two-plane slider, which also added several ticks of velocity last year and was often 84-86 mph. 
Apart from size, Martin checks every box you'd want a teenage pitching prospect to check. The context of his performance is important to consider, though, and until Martin has shown this kind of stuff across 100-ish innings (which we're probably two seasons away from actually knowing), it's reasonable to wonder whether or not he can. For every Marcus Stroman there are many more Deivi Garcías.

He has barely pitched in pro ball because the Brewers shut him down after he was drafted (which is pretty typical, especially in this org), he had a relatively minor elbow surgery early in 2022 that cost him most of the year, and further soreness nixed a planned Fall League stint at the end of that season. Henderson's 2023 got off to a delayed start to manage his innings, but he was dominant when he pitched. Across 18 starts at Low-A, including many second half starts of five or six innings, Henderson struck out 35% of opponents and had a 2.75 ERA. He did so despite sitting about 92 mph and using just two pitches, the other being his plus, screwball-style changeup. 
This spring, Henderson is throwing much harder, albeit in short outings. In his one Cactus League inning prior to publication, he was sitting 95-97. Context is important; Henderson is totally rested and worked just a single inning. But if Henderson is going to throw that hard for an inning at time, it could make sense to fast track him in relief since he might only be a reliever anyway. Henderson is a shorter guy with a high-effort delivery. He's thrown strikes as a pro, but he's also been hurt some and the look of his delivery is more typical in a bullpen. Then there's the issue of a third pitch, which Henderson is still searching for. He used an uphill cutter in 2023 but a source indicated to me that his breaking ball now has more slider shape in the 83-84 mph range. Whether or not that pitch is a hit this season might dictate which track Henderson ends up on, possibly by the middle of the year. His changeup is a pretty special pitch and, if paired with an uphill, mid-90s fastball for an inning at a time, is the sort of weapon you find on a higher-leverage reliever. I expect Henderson to be promoted very aggressively in 2024 because it's his 40-man evaluation year, and there's a chance it will make sense for Milwaukee to 'pen him late in the season and allow him to debut as a reliever in September without burning one of his options.",,"sa3020080"

Due to the risk associated with his hit tool, there was a gap between that ranking and where the industry saw him, and Graham fell to the second round and signed for $1.8 million. 
Graham has impressive all-fields power even though he's rail-thin, and his frame has room for another 15-20 pounds before compromising his mobility at short. He is an incredible athlete for his size, playing low-to-the-ground defense and showing big league-level comfort backhanding balls in the hole, hosing guys with his plus-plus arm. After he looked lost at the plate early during his junior year, Graham righted the ship and was much better during conference play, and he ended his college career hitting .320/.415/.584 while striking out 21% of the time. He has been conservatively assigned to Low-A Lakeland since signing with Detroit and hasn't exactly blown the doors off, as he's slashed .244/.341/.360 in 81 total games there, with his 2023 cut short by an abdominal strain. 
There are hit tool issues here that threaten Graham's whole profile. His pitch recognition (especially against sliders) and bat control aren't very good, and he tends to swing through a narrow band of the zone, not showing great tactile feel to hit. It's possible Graham will develop finer barrel control as he gets stronger and no longer has to incorporate his entire body to swing hard. That would perhaps help him move the barrel around with greater precision, but the slider recognition piece still looms. There are several hit tool bust risk indicators here, from Graham's lever length to his slider chase, and it might be foolish to continue to be seduced by hitters like this. But the high-end outcomes for Graham are exciting and huge, and I want to round up on how I'm valuing him even though he has a high-risk evaluation. So much of this is predicated on him staying at shortstop, the aspect of his profile I'm the most confident in. Big Graham years will look like Willy Adames' usual line, but it's much more likely he ends up tracking like Jose Barrero or Tim Beckham.",,"sa3019990"

His first pro season did not necessarily reinforce that view. Bonilla struggled with strikeouts in the DSL (24.3% K%) and his swing often looked disconnected, his footwork often mis-timed. We discussed sliding Bonilla below this FV tier (his pre-signing FV grade), but he still has a ton of power and is very young.

Despite that, his athleticism and mouth-watering pitch data were enticing enough for the Sox to draft him in the second round anyway. We wondered if aspects of Pallette's delivery would be altered during his rehab in order to help his fastball play a bit better, but when he returned his delivery looked more or less the same as it had prior to surgery, which is to say that it's still rather violent and his arm action is still on the longer side. Adjustments to his delivery may be necessary if Pallette keeps walking hitters at a nearly 13% clip like he did in 2023.
Pallette made 22 starts at Low-A last season, with his fastball sitting 92-95. That's not quite the peak pre-surgery arm strength that made him a potential top 15 pick, but it's still hard enough to project him as a big leaguer. Pallette's curveball is still a plus, high-spin offering to the eye, but this is a situation where the pitcher's fastball plane and curveball shape don't seem to mesh, and Pallette's changeup is now generating better results. His cambio has a ton of arm-side action and should mature into a plus pitch if it isn't already. The raw movement of Pallette's secondary stuff is exciting, but he needs to throw more strikes, and he might also need to make some other changes so his breaking ball's results can match its visual beauty.

His front side is a little stiff through the contact point, but Pratt rotates with verve through the hips and hit the ball with power on the showcase circuit.

Heubeck's fastball added a tick and a half of velo, averaging 93.5 mph across the entire season. He made more consistent use of two distinct breaking balls, both of which have lovely natural depth.

He steadily climbed through the Red Sox system and had an incredible beginning to the 2023 season with six starts at Double-A, during which he boasted a 0.82 WHIP and allowed just five total earned runs. Due largely to his lack of precision working in the strike zone, his stat line sagged upon a promotion to Triple-A, as Droahn's HR/9 grew more than sevenfold. Eleven of the 19 dingers he allowed at Charlotte came on belt-high beach balls. While his in-zone swing-and-miss took a tumble, his chase rate stayed in the mid-30s across both levels, and although he throws his slider more often, his changeup is his standout secondary in this regard, with a combined chase rate across the two levels of around 46%. He rarely threw the pitch to lefties, but righties struggled mightily against it, posting just a .154/.236/.262 slash line against the cambio in Drohan’s 89 innings post-promotion. Drohan’s Triple-A struggles were the first obvious stumbling block of his professional career, and if he can regain the command that allowed him to dominate at the lower levels, he could earn a role as a back-end starter.

The Kiwi Rake is similar to Bergolla, just not as good a defender. He was perhaps the Phillies' most exciting complex-level prospect in 2022, as he made searing all-fields contact throughout extended spring training and then again during the complex season proper, walking as much as he struck out and barely ever swinging and missing. He's a compact, short-levered lefty stick with fantastic barrel feel and hand-eye coordination, as well as enough physicality to do doubles damage right now. Additionally, Pouaka-Grego has a coherent two-strike approach, ditching his leg kick once he's deep in counts, spoiling tough pitches, and grinding away at opposing pitchers until he gets something to put in play. Because he is not physically projectable, it's likely that NPG's hit tool will need to carry most of the water if he's going to be an impact player, but all the early-career indicators here suggest that's plausible. While Pouaka-Grego is short, he isn't small, and his lower body is especially muscular and strong, so he's not in danger of lacking big league physicality as much as it's tough to project that he'll have big raw power at maturity.","LEmUdrRfsno","sa3018959"

Jarvis is built like Zach Davies and has a due north arm slot that helps impart carry on his fastball and 12-to-6 shape on his curveball. His command has never been very good, but his type of fastball gives him in-zone margin for error, so as long as he can throw hard, he should be able to get hitters out with a fastball-heavy approach. That may ultimately take a move to the bullpen to sustain, as Jarvis hasn't shown consistently good stuff as a starter. There's enough raw stuff here in terms of the fastball's traits and Jarvis' raw breaking ball quality to consider him a prospect, even though he wasn't rostered or taken in the Rule 5, because I want to see what happens to his arm strength if/when he's shifted to the bullpen.",,"sa3007775"

Like Mayo, Adams' size limits his mobility at third base enough to put his future there in doubt. Also like Mayo, Adams has a kind of ridiculous swing that seems to be working for him. He slashed .233/.400/.401 as a 19-year-old at Low-A last year, stole 30 bases and hit 11 homers. Adams' underlying hit data is even better than that. His contact metrics — 8% swinging strike rate, 83% in-zone contact — were impressive for a teenage hitter Adams' size and his measured power — 41% hard-hit rate, 112 max exit velo — even more so. The gap between Adams' spreadsheet power and his actual 2023 slugging was pretty substantial, indicating a 2024 breakout could be looming. 
But will Adams' swing hold water against upper-level pitching? He has a comically large leg kick and low hand load in the Yermín Mercedes mold, and his swing is bottom-hand dominant, covering the bottom of the zone. There's an awful lot going on and there are reasonable doubts about Adams' ability to time all the component parts as he climbs. And if he ends up moving to first base permanently, it's possible none of this will matter because he'll need to find another gear of offense to be a meaningfully good player at that position. Adams is off to an exciting start for a guy who signed for a little less than $300,000 a couple of drafts ago; he was already a good pick. That context can give us a sort of whiplash where we overvalue the player because of how much better things are going than anticipated and I'm being careful not to do that with Adams, who I now value on par with a second round prospect.",,"sa3020135"

On paper, that looks like high-end command, but the eyeball scouting report doesn't corroborate that. Gipson-Long lives in or near the zone because his line to the plate is so assertive and direct, but he doesn't have surgical touch-and-feel command, especially of his fastball. 
Built like a statuesque quarterback, Gipson-Long takes a big, cross-bodied stride toward the plate, and works from a low-three-quarters arm slot that imparts sink and tail on his low-90s fastball. Hitters who struggle with low-slot righties aside, Gipson-Long's fastball is fairly hittable, especially once opponents get a feel for his delivery. This is why he might be best suited for long relief, where he can lean even more heavily on his secondary pitches (his slider has big two-plane action, his changeup sinks a ton) and be a less efficient strike-thrower without knock-on effects for the rest of the pitching staff.",,"26048"

He tied for the top spot in the HR/FB column, though, matching the 18.8% posted by Orelvis Martinez, who also led the system in long balls, but Doughty’s overall fly ball rate was lower than most of the other players toward the top of the list of the Blue Jays’ most homer-heavy hitters, and was slightly outpaced by his groundball rate. His barrel rate and average launch angles were not in line with what would be expected from a prototypical power hitter (which he is not). Impressive as his bat-to-ball skills may be, they inspire an aggressive approach at the plate, with Doughty swinging early and often, and rarely getting deep into the count. Tightening up that pitch selection could allow him to better capitalize on his contact abilities. 
Defensively, Doughty split his time between second and third base, mostly at the latter. He’s a high-effort infielder, and his arm accuracy isn't great, particularly from across the diamond. His range and arm are a better fit at second base, but even there, his throws can be a bit wild on plays where he doesn't have time to plant his feet. He’s yet to firm up a defensive home, but his bat is advanced enough that even as a nomad, he could be a valuable addition to the lineup, especially if he can show a less aggressive, more intentional offensive approach.

After a standout 2022 headlined by an appearance in the Futures Game, Bush’s 2023 was peppered with several starts where he was on the unsavory end of a blowout. He missed spring training due to a groin injury, returning to the mound in early June and struggling to maintain his excellent performance from the season before. In 2022, he held opposing offenses to one or fewer earned runs in more than half of his starts with Double-A Rocket City, but he accomplished that feat in only five of his 17 starts in 2023, and he got shelled after he was traded to the White Sox. In particular, he has lost much of his ability to garner swings below the strike zone, which accounted for much of his success in 2022. 
There have been points in Bush's prospect past when he's thrown very hard, but last season his heater averaged just 92.5 mph and his fastball became incredibly hittable. Unless his arm strength rebounds, Bush will need to make effective and strategic use of his secondaries to hold down a big league role. His mix includes a slider that flashes above average, a mid-70s curveball with enough movement to play as a strike-getter in the zone, and a changeup that seemed the rustiest of his offerings after missing time. Bush ramped up the usage of his changeup after arriving in Birmingham post-trade. He wants to pepper the area at the top of the strike zone with his heater and then bury his two breaking balls off of that, but his fastball doesn't get enough chase for him to do this efficiently. He could pitch backwards with his breaking stuff and then use his fastball as a finishing pitch above the zone (the more velo the better), but any way you slice it, if he's only sitting 92, he's more likely to find his way into the bullpen as a multi-inning reliever than he is to profile as a starter.","MQVab799buY","sa3017386"

Ferris' combination of velocity (up to 96 mph), fastball carry, breaking ball snap, and frame give him meaningful upside. His feel for location is so raw that he has a little more relief risk than a typical $3-million signee, though sometimes guys with lanky frames like this gain control of their bodies later. 
Ferris has a powerful lower half, bending deep into his blocking leg. He also strides open, clearing his front side to help enable an extremely vertical arm slot. The combination of the two helps Ferris' fastball have flatter angle than is typical for a pitcher this tall and with such a high arm slot. If he can live more consistently at the top of the strike zone as he matures, his mid-90s fastball could dominate up there. The vertical slot helps him create depth on his breaking balls, and Ferris can turn over a changeup from that slot, albeit with some slot variation. He threw his changeup less than I expected last season and the quality of that pitch was a little worse than my pre-draft grades. The Dodgers have done a great job developing changeups and that pitch may yet take a leap in pro ball. Ferris' style of pitching with his fastball is such that he will probably always be an inefficient operator, but he has the raw stuff to be a no. 4 starter if he can improve his changeup and command.

As the process played out, he swung and missed at an elevated rate and his defensive forecast trended down the spectrum, from third base to maybe right field or first base due to his enormous size. The combination of hit tool and defense risk had me lower on Bitonti than the industry mean prior to the draft.

He posted an impressive 17.7% strikeout rate during that time that he nearly matched in walks (15.4%). He was stationed behind the dish in 23 of those games and saw opposing baserunners swipe 33 bags on him, as his arm is only so-so for a catcher.

The apex of Moore’s stock came while he was a sophomore at Arkansas, when he looked like a potential top 10 or 15 pick for the following year’s draft.

Instead, Moore signed with the Brewers for $800,000 as a second rounder. 
He spent 2023 at High-A Wisconsin, where he slashed .233/.321/.361.

The Phillies drafted him in the minor league phase of the 2022 Rule 5 Draft and Dunn had a huge power breakout in 2023 at Double-A Reading, where he hit .271/.396/.506 and slugged 21 homers, more than he had hit throughout his entire career entering 2023. Reading is a hitter’s haven and Dunn was in his age-25 season, so there are good reasons to be skeptical of his sudden change in output, but his underlying power metrics also took a leap, with his average and peak exit velocities (92 mph and 112 mph, respectively) cresting above the big league average. This isn't gigantic, impact power, but it’s meaningful pop for a second baseman. Dunn swings and misses quite a bit, especially within the strike zone, but he’s a dangerous all-fields hitter because of his power and ability to catch some fastballs deep in the hitting zone and punish them the other way. 
Dunn isn't an especially good defensive second baseman, nor is he versatile. He has spent a bit of minor league time at third base (including five AFL games) and in left field, but his lack of mobility and arm strength make him a below-average, second base-only defender in my eyes. This lack of versatility is the biggest barrier between Dunn and 2024 major league playing time.

Veras' dad played pro ball all over the world for 15 years, and he's Fernando Tatis Jr.'s cousin. You can see some of the family's ability in Veras' best swings. We'll never be all-in on a prospect like this, but Veras has started to defy convention and put himself in a position to play a power-hitting role in the middle of a lineup despite his flaws.

Pereira has struck out at a nearly 30% clip his entire minor league career. He swings hard and has plus power already at age 22, but his hands aren't particularly deft or precise, and his swing is kind of stiff and clunky in a way that leaves him vulnerable to several common pitch-type and location combinations (especially fastballs up, and including lots of sliders that don't quite turn the corner). Because we're talking about a left field-only defender, the offensive margin for error here is pretty slim. Will Pereira be able to consistently get to enough of his power in games to be a valuable contributor, even if it's just as the righty half of a corner outfield platoon? I buy that he could have an Aristides Aquino-style peak in him, but over time I expect that the issues with the hit tool will make him tough to roster. You could point to Pereira's early-career loss of reps due to injury and the pandemic (he signed in 2017, and by the end of 2021 had played just 109 games) as a context-driven reason to project on his hit tool. That's reasonable. But Pereira's tightly wound, muscular build is relatively maxed out for a 22-year-old and I think there's a chance he stiffens and slows sooner than is typical, so even if his hit tool levels up, his peak window might end up being short for a totally different reason. With the Yankees' current roster, Pereira, who got a 27-game cup of coffee in 2023, has a chance to earn an extended big league opportunity in 2024. Still, I think it's much more likely that Oswaldo Cabrera bounces back and claims left field for his own, or that the optionless Estevan Florial (whose swing looked different late in 2023) gets a longer initial look than Pereira, or that Austin Wells can't catch and ends up entrenched in left field, than I think it is that things will click for Pereira.",,"23695"

But Kopp's ability to find the strike zone evaporated during his senior year, his velocity regressed as he desperately aimed for the zone, and he de-committed from ASU, opting instead to go to South Mountain Junior College, where these issues continued. Fresh eyes got to watch Kopp throw in the MLB Draft League and at the Combine, and rather than fixate on and grow fatigued by his persistent issues, they saw a lefty with huge arm strength and a potentially good breaking ball. Now pro scouts can't believe Kopp signed for just $125,000. 
He spent the bulk of his first two seasons working as a starter for three innings at a time before the Dodgers put Kopp in the bullpen at the end of the 2023 regular season and Fall League. Kopp sits 95-98 and will occasionally touch 100 in relief. His north/south arm slot should theoretically impart big vertical depth on his breaking balls, but the shape and velo of those offerings is inconsistent, nasty at times and hittable at others.

He's an undersized righty with below average arm strength, but Rodriguez is an above-average athlete with a plus changeup and two good breaking balls, and he's now K'd 26% of upper-level hitters across a starter's load of innings. Rodriguez added a few ticks of velo in 2022 and has sustained it as his workload has increased. He sits parked in the 91-93 mph range and tends to create sink/tail action at release (which is why he can really turn his changeup over), but his (lack of) size and low-to-the-ground delivery create a shallow angle on his fastball, which makes it tough for some hitters to get on top of. 
Make no mistake, at just 92 mph on average that fastball is not an impact pitch, and Rodriguez has to rely on secondaries to get by. But all three of his other pitches are pretty good, especially Rodriguez's changeup, which generated a whopping 50% miss rate (per Synergy) in 2023. He'll mix in a variety of breaking ball speeds and shapes, as well. Rodriguez's line to the plate is incredibly direct and he should throw enough strikes to start, but he lacks precise command.

He suffered a severe back injury as an amateur before he signed with the Phillies for $600,000, and he's been limited to fewer than 80 regular season games each of the past two years due to a broken hand in 2022 and a strained quad suffered just a couple weeks after the Tigers acquired him from Philly for Michael Lorenzen at the 2023 trade deadline. 
While reduced sample sizes as a result of his injuries make this a bit less settled than I'd like, there are some statistical red flags here that caused me to slide Lee pretty substantially on this pass through the Tigers system. Chiefly, Lee struggles to hit fastballs. The way his swing works (he's a bucket strider with a path that tends to produce opposite field contact, in the style of a righty, less twitchy Eddie Rosario) not only makes it very difficult for Lee to pull fastballs, but to hit them at all. Synergy Sports has him hitting just .160 against fastballs 88 mph and above in a 150-pitch sample generated by tracking 2023 Jersey Shore and West Michigan broadcasts. This, in concert with my Fall League look — during which Lee was regularly getting worked by fastballs around his hands — has me pretty skeptical that this is going to work even though Lee's full-season contact data against all pitch types is closer to big league average. The big-bodied Lee needs to mash in order to profile because he'll likely be a below-average 2B/3B defender due to a lack of range and athleticism, and I think it will only get harder for him to do so as he faces better velocity and pitchers who are better at determining and exploiting hitter weaknesses.","bHu9T1Jye40","sa3017863"

He rarely expands the zone horizontally, but many of his hits came on offerings above or below the strike zone, so while swinging and missing is rare for Horwitz, when it does happen, it tends to be of the chase variety, primarily on high heaters and low breaking balls outside of the zone. He reached the big leagues in 2023, first for a cup of coffee in June, then to close out the season in September. Across that tiny sample, he didn't quite emulate the swinging strike, contact, or walk rates that made him a Triple-A standout, but considering the higher quality of his opponents, it would be unfair to call it a skid over such a short span; indeed, he “skidded” into the league-average range for all of the above.

He was a power-armed prep righty from Maryland who was ushered toward college by a Tommy John surgery he rehabbed from during a redshirt first year at South Carolina. He performed well throughout both healthy seasons in Columbia, with his innings total doubling from 2017 to '18. Cleveland shut him down after the 2018 draft, then asked him to make 20 starts (at a little over four innings per start) the following year, which is when he first popped up on my radar and Cleveland's prospect list. Morris was throwing very hard early in 2019, but his stuff wavered late in the season. During 2020 instructs, he was again parked in the mid-90s, up to at least 98 mph, and had a plus changeup and average curveball, but this was in a controlled developmental setting after he hadn't pitched all year. We moved Morris into the 40+ FV tier at that time as a way of indicating that he had big upside, while also factoring in the risk related to his injury track record and fluctuations in stuff. He got off to a late start in 2021 due to a strained lat, then was incredible when he first came back, punching out 36% of hitters while once again sitting 94-96 mph before dipping into the low-90s later in the year. Morris suffered a shoulder sprain during 2022 spring training and began rehabbing in July, slowly building to a month-long big league debut at the end of the season, earning a playoff roster spot in the process. Again his stuff was nasty, sitting mostly 94-95, while he made frequent use of a relatively new upper-80s cutter and finished hitters with his signature changeup. 
Morris' inability to stay healthy has made it tough for him to log starter-level innings as a prospect. As with Bo Naylor, the Guardians never optioned Morris after he was initially called up, preserving all three of his option years. Having bought themselves that extra time, they could theoretically continue to develop him as a starter, but Morris is ready right now. Deploying him in relief allows him to make an immediate impact on a competitive big league club and might help keep him healthy, and you can still ramp up his workload over time via a multi-inning relief role that gives him a long-term path to being a starter.",,"25388"

He saw action all over the infield in college and was fine at both second and third base; after the draft, he only played second base at Lakeland.

It's a good-looking swing and squeezes as much as is possible out of Roden's modest athleticism, but the change hasn't elevated his power to a place that profiles in left field. You can really limit his damage by staying away from him and throwing Roden fastballs, which he doesn't lift as well as secondary stuff. On top of that, Roden's feel for contact is a little artificial, and has more to do with his short levers than precise timing and barrel feel. He's great at adjusting to offspeed stuff and pulling inner-third stuff with lift, but he isn't dangerous all over the zone. We like him as a platoon stopgap or bench bat, not so much as an impact hitter.",,"sa3020212"

It looked like he'd seize a rotation spot along with Ty Floyd and Paul Skenes, but instead his elbow blew out just before the 2023 season and he needed Tommy John. Healthy Taylor works in the mid-90s with riding life and downhill angle; the latter detracts from the effectiveness of the pitch somewhat. He has a classic upper-70s overhand curveball to go with it, as well as a slider he barely throws. Taylor's longer arm action and somewhat violent delivery were bullpen indicators even before he got hurt. He has a non-zero shot to work in key spots if his peak velo returns in 2024 post-rehab.

It's tough to value a prospect in Henriquez's circumstances. His talent is on par with a top 30-ish draft pick, but he has only thrown about 50 innings each of his last three healthy seasons (when you combine regular season and backfield work), and he hasn't pitched in a year and a half. Even if we assume his stuff returns entirely, there are other questions to be answered here. Will the Dodgers' 2024 rehab plan for Henriquez be aggressive enough to put him in position for an offseason 40-man add, or will they take things slowly to discourage other teams from popping him in the Rule 5 Draft?

It's easy to bucket Crow as a righty specialist at first blush, but his surgical east/west command and breaking ball quality, especially his ability to vary the shape and depth of a couple different breakers, gives him the platoon-neutralizing weapons to be a starter. Healthy Crow has also shown murderous command. He hammers the zone with his upshot fastball and two different breaking balls, throwing basically all of his pitches for strikes at a 70% clip in 2022. He is a fantastic on-mound athlete who repeats his mechanics with robotic consistency. This enables Crow's slow fastball to stay out of danger because it's not usually left in the meat of the zone. His even fastball/breaking ball usage and ability to throw either for a strike at any time makes him very unpredictable.

He never really looked himself even when ""healthy,"" though his stuff has been so up and down since college that at times it's difficult to know which Burke is the real one. Peak Burke struck out 31% of opposing hitters at Double-A Birmingham in 2022; for most of that year, his fastball was parked in a career-best 93-95 mph zone while touching 97. You could project heavily on his strike-throwing (which wasn't great, even when he looked his best) and his secondary pitches because he was a serious multi-sport high schooler (hoops) who also missed a year of college reps because of TJ, and as a result was much less experienced than most other college prospects when he was drafted. Now that we've had years of mixed velo and injury, it's prudent to project Burke in the bullpen. 
His impact heater has top-of-the-zone utility, and it's the best weapon in Burke's four-pitch mix. Usage of his mid-80s slider/cutter has ticked up in pro ball, becoming Burke's best secondary pitch, while his changeup and curveball are deployed less frequently. Even though Burke's curveball can be easy to identify out of hand, it became more surprising for hitters to see once it became his third pitch, and it actually garnered the best whiff rate of all of his offerings when he was last healthy for a long period of time. It's possible a bullpen move will mean scrapping his changeup. 
The 2024 season will be Burke's 40-man evaluation year, and if he's healthy and back to throwing hard, we expect he'll be added after the season and play a multi-inning role starting in 2025. Because we're talking about a shoulder injury here, we'd like to see him healthy before pushing his FV grade back into the 40 or 40+ tier.","kIgHNMwtCh0","sa3017461"

His stuff and command have backed up a bit since then as the Dodgers and Yankees (Beeter was the prospect return for Joey Gallo) have deployed Beeter as a starter en route to a post-2023 40-man roster add. 
Beeter's delivery is stiff and his release is inconsistent, generating relief projection here for the last several years. He tilts out to create a vertical arm slot that helps impart the carry on his fastball (which often sails to his arm side) and the depth on his two breaking balls (which he actually has a better feel for landing in the zone than his heater), but Beeter has never had great feel for release and has run double digit walk rates for basically his entire career. He'll likely serve as a short-outing spot starter in 2024, but over time I expect Beeter to shift to a bullpen role. If his peak arm strength returns when such a move occurs, then Beeter could have late-inning stuff.

Duran's bulky size and violent delivery have been a somewhat scary aspect of his prospectdom since he first showed up on The Ranch, and despite his repertoire depth, there was relief risk rooted in his profile even before the injuries. Like Henriquez, Duran's 2024 rehab look and schedule is very important because he's Rule 5 Draft eligible after the season.

Instead he struggled with walks for two months before he was shut down with a forearm strain in early July. 
Santos is still frail looking. He is physically and mechanically similar to Jesse Chavez, utilizing a short-striding, low-slot delivery. These factors, plus Santos' track record of relatively poor strike-throwing, point to the bullpen. Optimists can point to Santos' excellent slider command, as well as his combination of youth and athleticism, as hopeful indicators that he can start. Santos's low slot creates sink and tail on his fastball, and he doesn't yet have good feel for running this shallow-angled pitch up the ladder. His changeup is still not awesome, but its usage and quality took a step forward in 2023, and you can continue to project on it based on Santos' athleticism. There is still a greater developmental distance for Santos to travel than other arms in Toronto's system, even the relief-only prospects.

Knack came into 2024 camp in better shape and was parked at 94 mph in early games. His fastball plays down a bit because of its angle, so it's important for him to throw hard. 
Knack makes heavy use of a mid-80s cutter/slider that he commands the best of all his pitches. His changeup, relegated to about 13% usage in 2023, is his best bat-misser from a rate standpoint, tailing in at around 82 mph, but Knack's feel for it is less consistent. The 2024 change in physicality here is interesting and has coincided with a velo bump that has given Knack average velocity again. I'm less likely to bucket him as a reliever out of hand, but Knack's sobering injury history is important to consider. Even if he can start, we're likely talking about a backend role, pretty similar in value to an on-roster reliever.

He mostly bullied A-ball hitters with big velocity and does not have a consistently plus secondary pitch. Pan's 2-to-7, low-80s slider is ahead of his inconsistent splitter right now, but his <em>best</em> splitters are his nastiest pitches. It's important that one of his secondary offerings gets better because Pan's fastball is likely to play down a bit as he climbs. The velo/age combo here is exciting, but I'm not projecting heavily on the secondary stuff or command because Pan is a relatively stiff athlete. I have him more in an up/down bucket.",,"sa3020878"

He started two Low-A games in early May, sat for a month, threw another three innings in early June, then was sidelined again until late July, when he reemerged on the complex for a couple of starts before rejoining Low-A in August. After three starts that month, and seemingly being back on a regular pitching schedule for the first time since 2021, he leapfrogged up to Double-A, finishing out the regular season there before a Fall League stint. At the higher level, his strikeout rate plummeted by nearly 20 percentage points, as he struggled to hit his spots consistently and was punished for it by the more advanced batsmen he was up against. Only about half of his offerings were in the zone (and that includes balls that were just slightly out of the zone, but still likely to be called strikes), and his out-of-zone chase rates weren't high enough to make up for it. 
What makes the wavering command most frustrating, though, is the quality of his stuff. His curveball, long considered a gem, is his best weapon for getting swings out of the zone with its plus vertical depth. He uses a more traditionally shaped slider to enhance his ability to deploy the curveball, and his changeup is deceptive thanks to his consistent arm speed. It’s a deep arsenal that somewhat mitigates the inconsistency of his fastball, which will vary in velocity and shape to the point that it’s dangerously hittable when offered up against advanced hitters.
The missed time – which has largely been due to complications from the TJ, rather than additional, unrelated injuries – and strict pitch-count limits resulted in a total of just 31.2 innings of work from the former second-rounder in 2023, and the persistent stopping and starting made it difficult for him to put together a string of dominant starts at any point in the season. But he put up better numbers during his time in the AFL, and his stuff, in particular his curveball, is tremendously enticing and could already be a viable weapon in a big-league bullpen, where his inconsistent fastball could be less of a thorn in his side.",,"sa3014713"

The game moves much slower for him than for most of the players around him. He isn't as toolsy as some of his surface stats (like his stolen bases) might suggest; instead, he is much more polished and skilled than the typical rookie-baller. He is similar to a scaled down version of Brayan Rocchio at the same stage, wielding bat control and baseball feel beyond his years. Delgado has mostly played second base and shortstop while striking out a paltry 12% of the time. The recipe for his contact success is one part bat control, one part Delgado's short levers (which help enable a pull-heavy style), and one part sentient approach, as he cuts his big leg kick with two strikes. He's put together well for such a small athlete, and I think he'll eventually be strong enough to compete at the big league level, but he probably won't be strong enough to be an impact player. There are other athletes who are a cleaner fit at shortstop tracking along with him (Hans Montero, Roderick Arias), so it might be tough for Delgado to get reps there.

He's young but has a relatively maxed out frame, and the way he trends athletically in the near future is going to be important to his defensive fit and his overall role. 
Areinamo has one of the more entertaining right-handed swings in pro baseball. It is evocative of the way Yuli Gurriel's masterful stroke looks through contact, but Areinamo's pre-swing gesticulations are unique to him. Even though he's a thicker guy, Areinamo is a gifted rotational athlete with WD-40'd hips whose offensive operation is about the way his body moves more than raw strength, which he lacks. He can move the barrel all over the place but expands the zone far too much. While he's often bailed out by his hand-eye coordination and barrel feel, Areinamo's tendency to swing at balls both hurts his OBP and also leads to a lot of weaker contact even though he's putting the ball in play a ton. 
As a poor defensive second baseman, he needs more than just one good offensive tool to succeed. I'm smitten with his rare hitting skill and swing aesthetic, but something has to change or develop here for Areinamo to be a big leaguer. He either needs to hit for more power, be more selective, or improve his defense in terms of quality and versatility.

The Dodgers acquired him from the Yankees as part of a 40-man crunch trade during the early portion of the 2023-24 offseason that sent Jorbit Vivas and Victor González to New York for Sweeney, who doesn't have to be 40'd until after the 2024 season. 
Though the Yankees only ever deployed him at shortstop, Sweeney is slower and heavier-footed than the typical big leaguer there. Some of the sweet looking plays he makes at the very extremes of his range an average big league shortstop would make look more routine. Sweeney is built like Josh Jung, and it's rare for an athlete that size to be an impact shortstop glove. Here, Sweeney is evaluated as a below-average shortstop defender, and his ultimate role will likely be a heavier mix of second and third based on his skill set. 
This has been the crux of Sweeney's defensive evaluation at FanGraphs since his draft year, and now we've also cooled a bit on his bat. His hands have so much pre-swing movement that we worry he won't consistently be on time against major league fastballs, and stiffness in Sweeney's lower half makes it difficult for him to scoop lower pitches. His underlying bat-to-ball performance (like his 8% 2023 swinging strike rate), propensity for airborne contact, and consistently excellent plate discipline is all evidence to the contrary, and it's plausible adjustments will coincide with the change of scenery.

So he’s swinging more (but not too much), and missing less, which speaks to the improvements he’s made at the plate. The extra swings simultaneously led to fewer walks and more slugging, resulting in roughly the same OPS as 2022. The majority of his hits come on pitches within a horizontal band just above his belt, and most of his overall swings come in that area of the zone as well. He rarely expands the zone, displaying a keen ability to lay off breaking balls below it – particularly impressive given his age. That he can be selective at the plate is a good thing, but it may mean that there are holes within the strike zone that more advanced pitchers would be able to exploit, so it behooves him to diversify the pitches he can connect with as he advances. 
Defensively, De Jesus still sees time at shortstop but he’s unlikely to stay there due to his comparative lack of range, and we've had him projected to third base here for a while now. He has difficulty finding a handle on the ball and getting it out of his glove cleanly when he’s on the run, and he sometimes gets ahead of himself in that regard, trying to get the ball out of his glove before it’s even in there, resulting it in clanging off the heal or exterior.

His best looking secondary pitch is his upper-70s curveball, which has big depth and plus raw movement, but it doesn't play great off of his fastball. Martinez often uses a mid-80s slider (it bites late, but lacks length and is almost cutter-y) and an upper-80s changeup; both pitches are below average right now. He is much more physically mature than most other pitchers his age, his build more akin to a catcher's, so there isn't an obvious path toward more velocity here.

When he did make his professional debut in 2021, he wasted no time displaying his offensive prowess, slashing .333/.458/.538 in 17 games on the complex. He’s steadily climbed the ranks of the system since then, splitting his 2022 more or less evenly between Low- and High-A, then spending the bulk of 2023 at Double-A before finishing out the season with a strong 20-game Triple-A stint. He’s consistently posted a wRC+ well above league average at every minor league stop, with his hard-hitting power an obvious stand-out trait, bolstered by savvy swing decisions and a patient approach that allows him to be selective at the plate and wait for pitches he knows he can crush. Palmegiani’s thump is largely of the pull variety and is most effective against fastballs, with 16 of his 23 home runs in 2023 (the most in the system from anyone not named Orelvis) coming on heaters, most of which were belt high, while the offspeed and breaking balls he sent out were mostly hang ‘em, bang ‘em mistakes from the pitchers. Defensively, he had spent most of his time at third base, but has never been a particularly comfortable fit there, and since reaching Triple-A, he has seemed to be more firmly planted at first base. His ability to punish pitchers for mistakes and pulverize fastballs to his pull side are good things to be sure, especially when he’s demonstrated patience, but doing so off of a greater variety of offerings will likely be necessary for him to carry his obscene offensive numbers up to the big league level.

His fastball sits 93-96 and plays up due to the incongruity between its shape and his release point, resulting in whiff and chase rates in the mid-30s on the heater.

His cambio usage jumped from 18% to 30% in 2023, in particular against lefties.

Rodriguez has an elite frame and body projection. He's built like an NBA shooting guard at a lanky, well-proportioned 6-foot-6, and his delivery has beautiful fluidity. His fastball sat 92-95 during the regular season and was peaking above that during instructs. The makings of a viable changeup and curveball are both here, with the changeup's development ahead right now. This is a deep projection arm who has a chance to throw harder into his mid-20s.","_FWX3h9oYwU","sa3015437"

He posted a whopping 17.9% swinging strike rate in 2023 while throwing fastballs 72% of the time. King really only has slightly above-average arm strength, but he hides the ball well and it's tough to get on top of his heater. He's a freaky sleeper for now because he and the Brewers need to find a better second pitch and more consistent strike-throwing ability during the next couple of seasons.",,"sa3018278"

While Freeland has all-fields doubles power, his swing is really only geared for low-ball contact, and he swings and misses an awful lot in the strike zone. As a somewhat dangerous switch-hitter and viable defender at every infield spot, there are lots of game situations where Freeland's skills are helpful and he's pretty likely to play a sixth infield role down the line.",,"sa3020653"

He hasn't had surface-level success as a pro in terms of ERA, but Casparius' stuff is pretty exciting, especially considering 2023 was just his third full season on the mound. Most impressive is his sweeper slider, which often looks like it's going to finish in the middle of the right-handed batter's box before it takes a hard turn and bends onto the corner of the plate. He uses this pitch most of all, both to get ahead of hitters and to finish them. It's a profile-making pitch, one he's likely to lean on disproportionately as he approaches the big leagues. Nothing else Casparius does is better than average. He has average arm strength and below-average command; his changeup and cutter are still developing, and Casparius barely threw them in 2023. Both of them have above-average raw movement and need to be harnessed. Developed as a piggyback starter so far, Casparius' more likely future role is in bulk relief.","kp4IugFqvTM","sa3017886"

Entering 2023, the pandemic and an unfortunately timed TJ had caused him to throw just 1.2 innings since 2019. Out of the gate last spring, Morillo was sitting 98-100 with uphill angle and a mid-80s slider that didn't have quite the same finish as it used to, perhaps because mechanical tweaks were made to alter his fastball shape. He held that velocity amid conservative usage throughout the season but wasn't dominant (34.1 IP, 33 H, 26 BB, 48 K), and Morillo was left off the 40-man roster and went unselected in the Rule 5 Draft. Neither Morillo's slider nor changeup is especially good; he's a one-pitch guy with below-average control right now. It's plausible his slider could still take a leap, as Morillo barely pitched for four years and got fewer than 40 innings of reps upon his return. He was again sitting 98-100 in his first spring outing of 2024 and is an older prospect in the system to monitor for secondary pitch improvements.",,"sa917772"

In 2023, he split the season across both A-ball levels as a single-inning reliever and struck out 88 hitters in 58 innings. Wepf is built like a whooping crane at 6-foot-5, 192 pounds, and the line on his fastball is extremely tough for hitters to get on top of. His mid-80s, two-planed slider is very difficult to spot out of his hand and has enough length to miss bats. Getting Wepf's endless limbs under control will be key to polishing his command. If he can, there's a pretty nasty middle reliever here.",,"sa3020704"

The compact Campbell has a minimalistic set-up and swing, with basically no stride and a very short load. He's a dangerous gap-to-gap hitter with this simple operation, which looks as though he's using a two-strike approach the whole time, expertly guiding the bat head around the bottom of the zone. Campbell does have trouble with up-and-away fastballs at times, and right field is a tough profile when you don't have a plus offensive tool. I'd really like to see if Campbell can once again mix an infield position into his defensive duties. If so, he'll likely hit enough to be a versatile part-time weapon.",,"sa3022751"

He's slowly added arm strength across the last three years and has gone from topping out at 97 to sitting there, and Jeffrey's best sliders are of the elite, all-world variety. He probably needs to develop much better control just to reach the big leagues, but his stuff is nasty and gives Jeffrey some prospect-y clout despite the hill he has to climb.",,"sa3018206"

Galiz's contact rates were up in 2023 and he's become a bit better of a receiver. He's going to have 30-grade power and still needs to improve his ball-blocking pretty badly. If Galiz can become a better all-around defender, then he'll be more of a stable on-roster backup. That's in play, but an eventual primary role is not.",,"sa3015700"

Synergy Sports had Mak sitting just shy of 93 mph during his junior year at Northwestern State but he was 96-97 during instructs, and his breaking ball had added nearly five ticks of velocity and was suddenly a plus offering in the 84-88 mph range. Makarewich struggled with walks in college and we've only seen impact velo from him for one innings at a time. He's more of an emphatic arrow up guy from the fall whose initial 2024 look needs to be monitored than he is a slam dunk big league relief prospect.","bsyKaedbsoQ",
